[SANDOR CLEGANE] immediately bows to the king , while [GREGOR CLEGANE] storms off the field . ser [LORAS] declares [SANDOR CLEGANE] the victor of the match to the [HOUND] ['S] discomfort . 
in the [RED KEEP] , lord [VARYS] meets with [EDDARD STARK] . [VARYS] tells him that the king is a fool and will soon be [DEAD] unless [EDDARD STARK] can save him . [EDDARD STARK] wants to know why [VARYS] is telling him this now . [VARYS] tells him he had to be sure [EDDARD STARK] could be trusted . 
he calls [EDDARD STARK] an honorable and true [MAN] , maybe the only one in the [CITY] . he also confirms that [JON ARRYN] was assassinated with a poison called the tears of [LYS] because he started asking questions . [ARYA] is chasing cats in accordance with her sword training . she chases one into the dungeons under the [CASTLE] , where she finds the [GREAT] dragon skulls of the [TARGARYENS] in storage . she hears [TWO] [MEN] [VARYS] and magister [ILLYRIO] mopatis of [PENTOS] talking . [VARYS] says that events have been set in motion and the [REBELLION] and the [WOLF] will soon be at each other's throats . war is almost upon the [SEVEN KINGDOMS] , as they planned , but it has [COME] too soon .

 [SANDOR CLEGANE] , ser [GREGOR CLEGANE] and ser [LORAS] at the tournament . 
afterwards , [VARYS] finds [LITTLEFINGER] in the [GREAT] [HALL] staring at the [IRON THRONE] . [VARYS] reveals that he knows about [LITTLEFINGER] ['S] assistance in [EDDARD STARK] ['S] investigation of [JON ARRYN] ['S] death and reminds [LITTLEFINGER] of the consequences that [MAY] befall him should the [LANNISTERS] discover his involvement . in response , [LITTLEFINGER] reveals that he already knows about [VARYS] having met with both [EDDARD STARK] and [ILLYRIO] just earlier that day , implying he knows of [VARYS]' allegiances across the [NARROW SEA] . their conversation is interrupted by [RENLY] , who informs them that [ROBERT BARATHEON] will be joining them at their [SMALL COUNCIL] meeting . 
 [ARYA] escapes from the dungeon and tries to warn her father about what she overheard but she gets the [WORDS] muddled up . they are interrupted by [YOREN] , who has ridden non stop from the [CROSSROADS INN] to bring [EDDARD STARK] forewarning of [CATELYN] ['S] arrest of [TYRION LANNISTER] . [EDDARD STARK] keeps the information to himself , while [ARYA] asks [JORY CASSEL] about the state of her father's household guard . [JORY CASSEL] tells her she does not have to worry about her father's safety . 
at the meeting of the [SMALL COUNCIL] , king [ROBERT BARATHEON] tells [EDDARD STARK] that [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] is pregnant and her son will have a claim to the [IRON THRONE] . he wants [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] , the unborn child , and [VISERYS] [DEAD] as soon as possible . . 
 [VARYS] secretly meets [ILLYRIO] under the [RED KEEP] . 
 [EDDARD STARK] states that this act would be dishonorable , cowardly , and beneath their dignity . the other members of the [SMALL COUNCIL] [PYCELLE] , [RENLY] , [LITTLEFINGER] and [VARYS] all concur that [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] must [DIE] for the good of the [REALM] . king [ROBERT BARATHEON] orders [EDDARD STARK] to enact the order . he refuses and resigns as the [HAND] of the king , to [ROBERT BARATHEON] ['S] utter disbelief and fury . 
 [EDDARD STARK] orders his household to begin packing . as [EDDARD STARK] is packing , [LITTLEFINGER] arrives and offers to take [EDDARD STARK] to the last place [JON ARRYN] went before he fell ill . [EDDARD STARK] agrees . 
ser [LORAS] and lord [RENLY] , who are lovers , meet in a bedchamber . [RENLY] complains as [ROBERT BARATHEON] is organizing a hunt in the kingswood , which will no doubt involve traipsing around the [FOREST] for a couple of weeks in the cold and rain waiting to [KILL] some animal . [LORAS] urges [RENLY] to claim the [CROWN] himself , offering him the allegiance of his rich and powerful family . [RENLY] dismisses the notion , since he is fourth in line to the [IRON THRONE] . [LORAS] points out that [JOFFREY] is a monster , that [TOMMEN] is only eight and laughs at the notion of [ROBERT BARATHEON] and [RENLY] ['S] other brother , lord [STANNIS] , ever becoming king , as he has the charisma and personality of a lobster . he also asserts that the people love [RENLY] and want to serve him because he is kind and doesn't revel in violence as his [BROTHERS] do . 
queen [CERSEI] and [ROBERT BARATHEON] share a rare drink and discussion about the [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] threat . surprisingly , [CERSEI] takes [EDDARD STARK] ['S] side , pointing out that the [DOTHRAKI] can not cross the [NARROW SEA] as they have no ships . . 
ser [LORAS] urges [RENLY] to consider his place in the line of succession . 
 [ROBERT BARATHEON] agrees , but if they land and the knights of [WESTEROS] take shelter behind their [CASTLE] walls , the [DOTHRAKI] could simply burn and pillage their way up and down the continent until the smallfolk accept [VISERYS] as their king regardless . [CERSEI] suggests that the unified armies of the [SEVEN KINGDOMS] could defeat them but [ROBERT BARATHEON] says she underestimates the skill and ability of one [ARMY] with one leader and one purpose as compared to that of the scattered and patchwork armies of [WESTEROS] . their discussion moves to [LYANNA STARK] , which surprises [ROBERT BARATHEON] , as in seventeen years [CERSEI] has [NEVER] asked about her . he tells her that [LYANNA STARK] ['S] death left in him a void that [SEVEN KINGDOMS] could not fill . he also tells her that their marriage [NEVER] had a chance of success because of the [HOLD] [LYANNA STARK] ['S] memory has on him , and bitterly adds he can barely remember what she looked like . [CERSEI] says that she felt something for [ROBERT BARATHEON] once , even after they lost their [FIRST] [BOY] , for quite a while . she asks [ROBERT BARATHEON] if there was ever any chance for their marriage and he answers no . 
 [LITTLEFINGER] brings [EDDARD STARK] to the last place [JON ARRYN] went before falling ill , which is one of littefinger's brothels . there [EDDARD STARK] meets another one of [ROBERT BARATHEON] ['S] [BASTARDS] , this time a girl , and her [MOTHER] , a blond whore named [MHAEGEN] . [MHAEGEN] remarks that her child has [ROBERT BARATHEON] ['S] nose and [BLACK] hair . [EDDARD STARK] asks [LITTLEFINGER] why [JON ARRYN] was searching for [ROBERT BARATHEON] ['S] [BASTARDS] but he says he doesn't know , offering the half hearted guess that maybe [ROBERT BARATHEON] suddenly took paternal interest in them . [EDDARD STARK] looks skeptical of that reason . 
leaving the brothel , [EDDARD STARK] , [JORY CASSEL] , and the [TWO] guards that accompanied them are confronted by a large group of [LANNISTER] guardsmen led by ser [JAIME LANNISTER] . [JAIME LANNISTER] has heard of [TYRION] ['S] arrest and demands an explanation . [EDDARD STARK] says that [TYRION] was arrested on his orders . . 
 [EDDARD STARK] is stabbed through the leg by a [JAIME LANNISTER] guardsman . 
 [JAIME LANNISTER] threatens to [KILL] [EDDARD STARK] but [EDDARD STARK] points out that if he does , [TYRION] will [DIE] as well . [JAIME LANNISTER] acknowledges that this is true , so he says he will settle for killing [EDDARD STARK] ['S] [TOMMEN] instead . there is a brief engagement in which [EDDARD STARK] ['S] [TWO] guards , heward and wyl , are killed by [JAIME LANNISTER] spearmen . in response , [NED] and [JORY CASSEL] fight and [KILL] [FIVE] of the [JAIME LANNISTER] soldiers . [JORY CASSEL] engages [JAIME LANNISTER] but is quickly killed when [JAIME LANNISTER] stabs him through the eye with a dagger . furious , [EDDARD STARK] crosses [SWORDS] with [JAIME LANNISTER] . [JAIME LANNISTER] is shocked and then exhilarated when the older [NED] is not as easily defeated as he expected . however , [JAIME LANNISTER] gradually starts to grow worried as [NED] ['S] [HIGH] level of skill becomes apparent . just as they are ready to clash again , a [JAIME LANNISTER] guardsman steps in and stabs [EDDARD STARK] through the leg with a spear , disabling him . [JAIME LANNISTER] is annoyed at the dishonorable interruption and knocks out the guardsman . he departs , telling [EDDARD STARK] he wants his brother back .

a furious [TYRION LANNISTER] marches in and puts a stop to the spectacle . he orders someone to cover [SANSA STARK] up and [SANDOR CLEGANE] immediately steps forward , taking off his cloak and proceeds to gently wrap it around her . [TYRION LANNISTER] turns his wrath upon [JOFFREY BARATHEON] , berating his actions as [SANSA STARK] is his future wife and queen that he is publicly shaming and the fact that [JOFFREY BARATHEON] doesn't pause to think how politically disastrous it would be for their allies to see him having his guards beat a valuable political hostage to a bloody pulp . furious , [JOFFREY BARATHEON] proclaims that he was punishing her . denouncing his nephew as a halfwit , [TYRION LANNISTER] points out the absurdity of punishing [SANSA STARK] for her brother's actions miles away in a war that [JOFFREY BARATHEON] himself started . now completely enraged , [JOFFREY BARATHEON] bellows that as king , he can do whatever he pleases , but [TYRION LANNISTER] again coldly counters that the [MAD] king thought he could do as he pleased too , which led to him being overthrown and killed . 
 [JOFFREY BARATHEON] torments ros to send a message to [TYRION LANNISTER] .

bronn suggests to [TYRION LANNISTER] that as an angry young [WOMAN] , maybe what [JOFFREY BARATHEON] needs is to have sex with a [WOMAN] , and that they should set him up with a prostitute . [TYRION LANNISTER] agrees that maybe this would give [JOFFREY BARATHEON] a chance to release his frustrations away from [SANSA STARK] . indeed , he might even be grateful for the gesture given that he didn't have much of a father figure in [ROBERT BARATHEON] to set him straight , doing something nice for the [BOY] might even be the [SECOND] chance [JOFFREY BARATHEON] needs to re establish a relationship with a male family figure . so [TYRION LANNISTER] arranges for [TWO] prostitutes from [LITTLEFINGER] ['S] brothel , ros and [DAISY] , to entertain [JOFFREY BARATHEON] . unfortunately , the attempt fails horrifically instead of trying to have sex with the prostitutes , [JOFFREY BARATHEON] brings a loaded crossbow into the bedchamber . at crossbow point , [JOFFREY BARATHEON] forces ros to beat [DAISY] unconscious , and then to dump her body in [TYRION LANNISTER] ['S] chambers , to send his uncle a message warning him not to interfere with his handling of [SANSA STARK] again . 
as [TYRION LANNISTER] works in his chamber late at [KNIGHT] , his cousin [LANCEL LANNISTER] knocks on his [DOOR] delivering orders from [CERSEI] to release [GRAND] maester [PYCELLE] from the dungeon at once . despite their [BLOOD] relationship [LANCEL LANNISTER] clearly holds [TYRION LANNISTER] in contempt and openly calls him [IMP] . curious , [TYRION LANNISTER] asks why [LANCEL LANNISTER] is so late delivering the message . blundering into a rather obvious trap , [LANCEL LANNISTER] retorts that he always delivers messages immediately and is [NEVER] late . [TYRION LANNISTER] then simply points out how odd it is that [LANCEL LANNISTER] would be [COMING] from [CERSEI] ['S] bedchambers in the middle of the [KNIGHT] . [LANCEL LANNISTER] nervously says [CERSEI] often works tirelessly keeping late hours , but [TYRION LANNISTER] also notices that he reeks of [CERSEI] ['S] favorite lavender oil perfume . [TYRION LANNISTER] enquires whether [LANCEL LANNISTER] was made a [KNIGHT] before or after he started sharing [CERSEI] ['S] bed . [LANCEL LANNISTER] falls apart , saying that [CERSEI] ['S] father ordered him to obey her every command when he became a squire to king [ROBERT BARATHEON] . [TYRION LANNISTER] sarcastically asks if [CERSEI] forced him to have sex with her too . [TYRION LANNISTER] wonders aloud what [JOFFREY BARATHEON] would do if he found out that [LANCEL LANNISTER] had not only killed [JOFFREY BARATHEON] ['S] father but was also sleeping with his [MOTHER] . [LANCEL LANNISTER] gets down on his knees and pleads for his life . [TYRION LANNISTER] gently instructs [LANCEL LANNISTER] that he won't tell , but from now on , [LANCEL LANNISTER] must report everything [CERSEI] does back to [TYRION LANNISTER] . as [LANCEL LANNISTER] leaves , he also casually agrees that he will accede to [CERSEI] ['S] request and [FREE] [PYCELLE] if she wants him as a pet , though he doesn't want him back on the [SMALL COUNCIL] . 
 [PETYR] [LITTLEFINGER] [BAELISH] arrives at king [RENLY] [JOFFREY BARATHEON] ['S] camp as a political envoy from king [JOFFREY BARATHEON] at king's [LANDING] . he tries to gain [RENLY] ['S] trust by implying that if [RENLY] does march on the capital , he will help take down the [LANNISTERS] from within it is unclear if he is lying , but he is also ready to jump ship if the [LANNISTERS] lose , and [STANNIS] is not an option , because [STANNIS] despises [LITTLEFINGER] [RENLY] is tempted by the notion , despite his dislike for [LITTLEFINGER] . [LITTLEFINGER] then has a conversation with queen [MARGAERY TYRELL] in which he tries to intimidate her by hinting that her husband is homosexual . he does not anticipate that [MARGAERY TYRELL] seems to already know and not to care . [MARGAERY TYRELL] is not a naive ingenue like [SANSA STARK] but versed in court strategies she honestly believes that [RENLY] is the best candidate for king , and voluntarily entered into a paper marriage to secure the political alliance between [RENLY] and [HOUSE TYRELL] . [BAELISH] then meets with [CATELYN STARK] , who is still furious at his betrayal of her husband to his death . [BAELISH] [FIRST] tries to kindle a romance with her , saying that now they are both [FREE] , it [MAY] be that they can be together . [CATELYN STARK] simply draws a dagger and demands that he stop speaking . discouraged , he moves on to present [TYRION LANNISTER] ['S] offer that the [LANNISTERS] want to make a prisoner exchange with the [STARKS] if they release [JAIME LANNISTER] , queen [CERSEI] will release both [SANSA STARK] and [ARYA STARK] [BAELISH] lies about the [LANNISTERS] having [ARYA STARK] . [CATELYN STARK] insists that [ROBB] would [NEVER] allow the exchange , but [LITTLEFINGER] tries to manipulate her love for her imprisoned daughters . as a show of good [FAITH] from [TYRION LANNISTER] , [BAELISH] brings forward a pair of [SILENT SISTERS] carrying a box containing the remains of [NED STARK] . deeply grieving , [CATELYN STARK] tells [PETYR] to get out . she looks at the [BONES] with pain , but then shuts the box with a look of resolve on her face . 
the [SHADOW] wrenches itself [FREE] from [MELISANDRE] ['S] womb . 
king [STANNIS BARATHEON] then arrives at [RENLY] ['S] camp , along with the [RED PRIESTESS] [MELISANDRE] and ser [DAVOS] seaworth in his retinue . [STANNIS BARATHEON] has [COME] to treat with [RENLY] and give him the chance to willingly relinquish his claim and serve his older brother . [RENLY] , along with his [KINGSGUARD] members [BRIENNE] and ser [LORAS] [HOUSE TYRELL] , counters that no one wants [STANNIS BARATHEON] to be king . [RENLY] also scoffs at [STANNIS BARATHEON]' conversion to the religion of the lord of [LIGHT] . [CATELYN STARK] criticizes both [BROTHERS] for acting like sulking [CHILDREN] . [STANNIS BARATHEON] counters that it is odd that [CATELYN STARK] is standing alongside [RENLY] , given that her own husband [NED STARK] rejected [RENLY] ['S] initial plan to claim the [THRONE] and supported [STANNIS BARATHEON] as [ROBERT] ['S] rightful heir , even at the cost of his own life . in a display of leniency that is uncharacteristic for him , [STANNIS BARATHEON] offers [RENLY] that if he relinquishes his claim , [STANNIS BARATHEON] will grant him his [OLD] seat on the [SMALL COUNCIL] , and even [NAME] him as his heir unless [STANNIS BARATHEON] ever has a son in the future . [CATELYN STARK] reminds [STANNIS BARATHEON] that their common enemy is the [LANNISTERS] , but he will not hear it , again asserting his right to the [IRON THRONE] . [RENLY] states that the 100 , 000 soldiers waving his [BANNERS] makes him king , and [STANNIS BARATHEON]' [SMALL COUNCIL] [ARMY] is hopelessly outnumbered . [STANNIS BARATHEON] says that they shall see the next morning when their armies clash , and he departs . as she leaves [MELISANDRE] warns , look to your sins lord [RENLY] , for the [NIGHT] is [DARK] and full of terrors . [RENLY] watches his brother fade into the distance and asks his companions if they can believe that he loved [STANNIS BARATHEON] once . 
at king [STANNIS BARATHEON]' command , ser [DAVOS] rows [MELISANDRE] to some caves located near [RENLY] ['S] camp . [DAVOS] knows these caves from his [OLD] smuggling days . [MELISANDRE] asks him about whether he desires her , and his views on the conflict they are involved in between right and wrong , insisting that she is on the side of good . they find the way through the caves is blocked by metal bars . [MELISANDRE] takes off her cloak revealing that she is naked and heavily pregnant and promptly gives birth to a creature made entirely of [SHADOW] , as ser [DAVOS] looks on in horror .

[JEOR MORMONT] is angry that [SAM] wasn't able to send off any messenger ravens in the confusion of the attack . [JEOR MORMONT] announces that they must retreat back to the [WALL] , not simply to save their own lives but because [CASTLE BLACK] and the rest of [WESTEROS] must be warned of the [COMING] threat otherwise everyone they've ever known will [DIE] .

[MANCE RAYDER] himself is an unassuming [MAN] sitting in a corner , who then introduces himself and tells [JON SNOW] to stand , as no [MAN] kneels before another among the [FREE FOLK] , as they do not recognize a class of nobility in their culture . 
 [MANCE RAYDER] says he is glad that [JON SNOW] killed [QHORIN] , as he had killed many of [MANCE RAYDER] ['S] [WILDLINGS] , though he notes that [QHORIN] was his brother once , back when he was a member of the [NIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] and [QHORIN] had a whole [HALFHAND] .

bronn confronts [TWO] [KINGSGUARD] . 
in king's [LANDING] , king [JOFFREY BARATHEON] ['S] forces stand victorious after the [BATTLE] of the [BLACKWATER] . [HOUSE LANNISTER] ['S] [NEW] allies [HOUSE TYRELL] begin to settle into the capital . [TYWIN LANNISTER] bluntly tells his son [TYRION] that he intends to disinherit him . this comes as a shock , because his older brother [JAIME] gave up all right to inherit his father's [LANDS] when he joined the [KINGSGUARD] , and [TYRION] is rightfully the next in line of succession . for that matter , despite all evidence to the contrary , [TYWIN LANNISTER] refuses to believe that [TYRION] was in any way helpful in the defense of the [CITY] or during his months as acting [HALFHAND] of the king . instead , [TYWIN LANNISTER] obstinately maintains his belief that [TYRION] is a whore mongering , drunken , ill made , spiteful little creature , and that he is lying about all of his accomplishments out of envy . [TYWIN LANNISTER] is particularly insulted that [TYRION] brought his mistress , [SHAE] , to the capital when [TYWIN LANNISTER] explicitly told him not to , which makes [TYWIN LANNISTER] convince himself that [TYRION] was in bed with [SHAE] most of the time while events spiraled out of control . when [TYRION] asks why his father is doing this , [TYWIN LANNISTER] is shocked as if [TYRION] insulted him , and says it should be obvious as [TYRION] killed his [MOTHER] joanna in childbirth so that he might enter the world . [TYWIN LANNISTER] says that the [LAWS] of [FIRST MEN] say he has to let [TYRION] use his family [NAME] , but that he wishes he could prove [TYRION] wasn't his son , so his very existence would not continue to make a mockery out of the [NAME] [TYWIN LANNISTER] which he stole from [TYWIN LANNISTER] . [TYRION] fumes at the situation to his sellsword bronn , who has recently been knighted as a reward for his service in the [BATTLE] of the [BLACKWATER] . he now styles himself as ser bronn of the [BLACKWATER] , and while possessing no [LANDS] , wealth , or title , this drastically elevates his social standing and in his mind , his pay . 
meanwhile , [JOFFREY BARATHEON] ['S] ride back from the [GREAT SEPT] of [BAELOR] in a heavily guarded palanquin is interrupted when his betrothed , lady [MARGAERY TYRELL] , stops the procession in [FLEA BOTTOM] unexpectedly . [MARGAERY TYRELL] shocks the guards and bewilders [JOFFREY BARATHEON] by getting out and exploring , eventually arriving at an orphanage and interacting with the [CHILDREN] . meanwhile , her servants pass out bread and toys , earning her the love of [FLEA BOTTOM] ['S] smallfolk . that evening , [JOFFREY BARATHEON] and [CERSEI] visit [MARGAERY TYRELL] and her brother [LORAS] [MARGAERY TYRELL] for a [SMALL] dinner party . [CERSEI] admonishes [MARGAERY TYRELL] ['S] boldness and reminds her that her impromptu charity work took place on the same streets where the royal party was assaulted weeks earlier . 
when [JOFFREY BARATHEON] naively defends [MARGAERY TYRELL] and criticizes his [MOTHER] , [CERSEI] realizes that she is on the verge of being outmaneuvered . [CERSEI] only knows how to rule through fear , but [MARGAERY TYRELL] knows how to [TYWIN LANNISTER] the love of the people she rules over , a skill [CERSEI] lacks . [SANSA STARK] and [SHAE] sit on the docks watching ships arrive and depart . [SANSA STARK] wants to play a [GAME] making up stories about where the ships are headed , but [SHAE] , in typical fashion , is uninterested . [PETYR] [BAELISH] arrives to speak with [SANSA STARK] . 
she displays an eagerness to leave as soon as possible . he suggests that when he next leaves the capital by [SEA] , she might be able to stow away . [SANSA STARK] advises him not to give her too many details since she is a terrible liar . meanwhile , ros , who seems to be acting as [LITTLEFINGER] ['S] aide , reminisces about the day [SANSA STARK] was born , when all the bells in [WINTERFELL] were rung in celebration . she asks [SHAE] to look out for [SANSA STARK] , particularly in regards to [LITTLEFINGER] . 
on [DRAGONSTONE] , king [STANNIS BARATHEON] ['S] shattered forces regroup after being almost totally destroyed in the [BATTLE] of the [BLACKWATER] . [DAVOS] seaworth is rescued from the [SEA] by [SALLADHOR] saan after being thrown overboard by the [WILDFIRE] blast in the [BATTLE] . forlorn over the death of his son [MATTHOS] , [DAVOS] feels that [MELISANDRE] has led [STANNIS BARATHEON] to disaster , and is horrified to hear from [SALLADHOR] that she has begun to conduct human sacrifices . after the defeated remnant of [STANNIS BARATHEON]' forces returned to the [ISLAND] , [MELISANDRE] ordered any who spoke out against her to be burned alive as offerings to the lord of [LIGHT] . [DAVOS] convinces [SALLADHOR] to bring him to [DRAGONSTONE] . he finds [STANNIS BARATHEON] despondent , sitting in the chamber of the painted table alone with [MELISANDRE] . [DAVOS] openly calls [MELISANDRE] his enemy , condemns her for conducting human sacrifices , and says she is leading [STANNIS BARATHEON] astray . she counters that it was [DAVOS] who urged [STANNIS BARATHEON] not to bring her to the [BATTLE] , and implies that it was actually [DAVOS]' fault that thousands of their [FIRST MEN] burned to death , including his own son . at the mention of his son [DAVOS] draws a knife on her in a fit of anger , but he is restrained by the guards , and [STANNIS BARATHEON] orders him put in the dungeon . 
 [DAVOS] tries to [KILL] [MELISANDRE] . 
in the [RIVERLANDS] , the morale of king [ROBB STARK] ['S] [ARMY] is starting to wane . they have not had a significant victory since the [BATTLE] of [OXCROSS] months ago , and the news of the [LANNISTERS]' victory over [STANNIS BARATHEON] and [NEW] alliance with the [TYRELLS] piles bad news upon bad news . [ROBB STARK] has won every [BATTLE] he has ever fought , but the [LANNISTERS] finally realized it was too difficult to try to attack him head on , so they have shifted to the [NEW] strategy of simply fleeing ahead of [ROBB STARK] ['S] [ARMY] . [ROBB STARK] ['S] forces have won many [SMALL] but also insignificant minor victories , as the [LANNISTERS] are now determined to simply wait [ROBB STARK] out and exhaust his [ARMY] far from [HOME] while they slowly rebuild their own numbers and gain [NEW] allies . in frustration , [ROBB STARK] launches a [NEW] offensive to the east which takes the [GREAT] [CASTLE] of [HARRENHAL] , which [TYWIN LANNISTER] had been using it as the main [TYWIN LANNISTER] forward base in the [RIVERLANDS] during the [FIRST MEN] year of the war . however , [ROBB STARK] does not find the decisive victory he was hoping for [TYWIN LANNISTER] withdrew his garrison to king's [LANDING] to counter the attack by [STANNIS BARATHEON] , and didn't even bother wasting any [FIRST MEN] on a token defense of the [CASTLE] . [ROBB STARK] and his forces are further demoralized to find that the [LANNISTERS] massacred [TWO] hundred [NORTHERN] and [RIVERLANDS] prisoners of war before they left , and the courtyards are choked with piles of bodies . they do find one survivor , a maester named [QYBURN] .

 [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] ['S] ship arrives at the [CITY] of [ASTAPOR] in [SLAVER] ['S] [BAY] after leaving [QARTH] . [DAENERYS TARGARYEN]' [DRAGONS] are continuing to grow , and are now about the size of [SMALL] dogs . they fly about their ship as it approaches the [CITY] , plucking fish from the [SEA] and roasting them in mid air with their [WILDFIRE] breath.she notes that they are still not big enough to use as weapons of war to invade [WESTEROS] with , and that she needs an [ARMY] . ser [JORAH MORMONT] notes that the elite warrior eunuchs produced in [ASTAPOR] , known as the [UNSULLIED] , are said to be among the finest soldiers in the world . [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] stresses that they are slave soldiers , a distinction which [MAY] make some look on her negatively in [WESTEROS] where slavery is illegal , but [JORAH MORMONT] says they have no better ideas for how to acquire an [ARMY] . [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] expresses interest in expanding her tiny [DOTHRAKI] [KHALASAR] most of them are seasick because the [DOTHRAKI] have [NEVER] traveled on ships before , but [JORAH MORMONT] says that other [DOTHRAKI] will only join her if they think she is strong , and for that she needs an [ARMY] . 
upon arriving at [ASTAPOR] , [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] is given a tour of the [UNSULLIED] barracks by the [UNSULLIED] ['S] owner , [KRAZNYS] mo nakloz , with his slave girl [MISSANDEI] translating his low [VALYRIAN] into the common tongue of [WESTEROS] for [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] . they explain that the [UNSULLIED] are trained for [BATTLE] from the age of [FIVE] , and that only one in four recruits survives the training . [KRAZNYS] also demonstrates that the [UNSULLIED] do not fear pain or death by slicing off the nipple of one soldier much to [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] ['S] disgust , who not only shows no sign of pain , but thanks the slavemaster for the opportunity to serve him . [KRAZNYS] goes on to explain that the [UNSULLIED] are trained to show no [MERCY] or weakness by killing a newborn slave child in front of its [MOTHER] at the [END] of their training . [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] is outraged by this , but still asks how many [UNSULLIED] are available . she is told there are eight thousand soldiers for sale and that she has until the next day to make a decision . 
en route back to their ship , ser [JORAH MORMONT] urges that [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] should purchase the [UNSULLIED] , arguing that under her command , these slave soldiers will have a far better quality of life serving her than they would under [KRAZNYS] and his ilk . [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] is distracted by a playing child following her and [JORAH MORMONT] , and neither notice a [MAN] in a hooded [BLACK] cloak following them , armed with a dagger . . 
 [BARRISTAN] saves [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] from a deadly manticore .

[DAENERYS TARGARYEN] realizes the assassin was likely an agent of the surviving warlocks of [QARTH] . 
turning her attention to her savior , [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] is surprised when the [MAN] addresses her as his queen and removes his hood . she asks if [JORAH MORMONT] knows the [MAN] . a stunned [JORAH MORMONT] admits he does the [STRANGER] before them is one of the most skilled fighters in [WESTEROS] ser [BARRISTAN SELMY] , lord commander of [ROBERT BARATHEON] ['S] [KINGSGUARD] . falling to his knees , ser [BARRISTAN SELMY] explains that following [ROBERT BARATHEON] ['S] death and his dismissal by [JOFFREY] , he has been searching for [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] stormborn , to beg her forgiveness and offer his service , hoping to make amends for failing [HOUSE TARGARYEN] during and after [ROBERT BARATHEON] ['S] [REBELLION] , when he served in her father's [KINGSGUARD] .

[BRAN STARK] asks if prophetic dreams are part of being a warg , but [JOJEN] explains that's a different , related ability . the [SIGHT] allows those who possess it to see events that haven't happened yet , or events that happened [LONG] before they were born , or events happening now but thousands of miles away . [JOJEN] confirms that [BRAN STARK] ['S] dream of his father [EDDARD] the day he died was an example of the [SIGHT] , and that [JOJEN] himself had a similar dream the same day . he says that when he told his father , lord [HOWLAND] [HOUSE REED] , he openly wept , for he correctly realized that his son's dream signified that [EDDARD] was [DEAD] .

[SANSA STARK] is initially reluctant , but when [OLENNA TYRELL] mentions her father , [SANSA STARK] breaks down and , her eyes blazing , angrily recounts how [JOFFREY BARATHEON] had said he would show her father [MERCY] , only to behead him in front of her , and how he then took her up to the [WALL] and forced her to look at her father's head on a spike and claim him providing her father with a swift death was [MERCY] . realizing what she has just been saying , [SANSA STARK] nervously attempts to backtrack . [OLENNA TYRELL] continues to prod [SANSA STARK] as she fidgets around , and it becomes obvious that she is visibly afraid about being overheard . after enough times of [OLENNA TYRELL] insisting that she can trust her not to repeat what she says , [SANSA STARK] blurts out that [JOFFREY BARATHEON] is a monster . [OLENNA TYRELL] is disappointed , but unsurprised , given the rumors that have been circulating about [JOFFREY BARATHEON] ['S] public outbursts . [SANSA STARK] is worried that this means the [TYRELLS] will cancel their proposed marriage alliance meaning [SANSA STARK] will be stuck with [JOFFREY BARATHEON] again , but [OLENNA TYRELL] assures her that her son [MACE] is too intent on [MARGAERY TYRELL] entering into a royal marriage to cancel it for anything . 
 [SHAE] sneaks into [TYRION LANNISTER] ['S] [NEW] chambers . he warns her that his father threatened to [KILL] her if he found her with him again , and that his father follows through on such threats . undeterred , [SHAE] starts undressing [TYRION LANNISTER] , and asks him for a favor to protect [SANSA STARK] from [BAELISH] . [TYRION LANNISTER] says that he no longer has enough power or influence to attempt to do that , though [SHAE] accuses him of being attracted to [SANSA STARK] , which he cheerfully denies . it also comes out that [TYRION LANNISTER] had sex with ros back in the [NORTH] , though [TYRION LANNISTER] points out it was before he met [SHAE] . they playfully bicker about it as they start having sex . 
 [MARGAERY TYRELL] finds a way to bond with [JOFFREY BARATHEON] . 
 [MARGAERY TYRELL] is summoned to [JOFFREY BARATHEON] ['S] chambers to see if she needs anything before he leaves on a hunting trip . while [JOFFREY BARATHEON] has previously been easy for [MARGAERY TYRELL] to manipulate , [CERSEI] was apparently able to plant one seed of doubt in his mind the fact that [MARGAERY TYRELL] was married to his uncle [RENLY] and thus , already had sex with another [WOMAN] , whom [CERSEI] described as a traitor and known degenerate . when questioned , [MARGAERY TYRELL] says that she was ordered to marry a traitor as her family duty , but [JOFFREY BARATHEON] implies that this still means he must have had sex with her . [JOFFREY BARATHEON] angrily questions [MARGAERY TYRELL] about the relationship and she delicately placates him by feigning demure shyness and painting herself as a dutiful , but frustrated , bride . she uses the rumors about [RENLY] ['S] homosexuality to redirect [JOFFREY BARATHEON] ['S] anger , stating that [RENLY] always found excuses to avoid sex , but , in one instance , drunkenly suggested something that sounded very painful and could not possibly result in [CHILDREN] , which draws her [NEW] fiance's sympathy . [MARGAERY TYRELL] eventually manages to divert attention to the [NEW] custom crossbow [JOFFREY BARATHEON] ['S] had made for his excursion . it quickly becomes apparent that [JOFFREY BARATHEON] is excited by violence and sadism , so she flirts with him by complimenting the crossbow and musing about killing something herself . easily played , [JOFFREY BARATHEON] offers to take her with him to share in the excitement of killing something . 
king [ROBB STARK] settles into the [COUNCIL] chamber at [HARRENHAL] with his wife queen [TALISA] . lord [ROOSE BOLTON] interrupts them with [TWO] messenger [RAVEN] missives , each of which brings bad news . [FIRST] , [ROBB STARK] ['S] maternal grandfather [HOSTER TULLY] has finally died after a [LONG] illness at his [CASTLE] of [RIVERRUN] . [SECOND] , [ROOSE BOLTON] delivers a letter from his bastard son [RAMSAY SNOW] , stating that the [IRONBORN] torched [WINTERFELL] and put all of its inhabitants to the sword , and then fled all before his force arrived there . there has been no sighting of [BRAN] or [RICKON] , and though [ROBB STARK] hopes that they are still alive , there is a strong possibility that they are [DEAD] . moreover , there has been no word of [JOFFREY BARATHEON] , and if he took the boys captive the greyjoys haven't sent out any demands . this double blow reduces [CATELYN STARK] to tears and she laments that she had not seen her father in years . she is horrified at the thought that [BRAN] and [RICKON] were in danger while she was away and could not protect them , and are now likely [DEAD] . 
 [ROBB STARK] leaves [ROOSE BOLTON] in command of [HARRENHAL] with a detachment of the [NORTHERN] [ARMY] while [ROBB STARK] leads his main host back across the [RIVERLANDS] to [RIVERRUN] . lord [RICKARD KARSTARK] angrily says that this is a [WASTE] of time , though [ROBB STARK] points out that [CATELYN STARK] ['S] brother and his uncle , [EDMURE] [HOSTER TULLY] , is now lord of [RIVERRUN] and his levies will reinforce their [ARMY] . [RICKARD KARSTARK] maintains that unless [EDMURE] has been breeding soldiers like rabbits , it will make no difference with their [NEW] [MARGAERY TYRELL] allies , the [LANNISTERS] now outnumber them over [TWO] to one . [ROBB STARK] asks if [RICKARD KARSTARK] has lost [FAITH] in their cause , and [RICKARD KARSTARK] says he still believes in revenge . however , the fact that [ROBB STARK] lost his [HOME] [CASTLE] makes him seem vulnerable in the eyes of his bannermen , and many no longer believe in [ROBB STARK] as they once did . lord [RICKARD KARSTARK] asks to speak his mind as if he wasn't already , and says that he thinks [ROBB STARK] lost the war the day he married [TALISA] , a political nobody , throwing away any opportunity to forge marriage alliances with badly needed allies , specifically breaking his promise to enter into a marriage alliance with [HOUSE FREY] . 
 [TALISA] notices that [CATELYN STARK] is making a prayer wheel for the [FAITH] of the [SEVEN] , and offers to help . [CATELYN STARK] explains that they can only be made by mothers who are praying for the welfare of their [CHILDREN] . [CATELYN STARK] reveals that she has only made them twice before , one of which was when she was praying for [BRAN] to wake from his coma , which worked after a fashion , as he did survive though he lost the use of his legs . [TALISA] asks after the other time , and [CATELYN STARK] says that when they were younger , one of the boys had a pox , and maester [LUWIN] said that if he survived the [NIGHT] he would be all right , but that it would be a [LONG] [NIGHT] . [CATELYN STARK] explains that the [BOY] was [JON SNOW] , and at [FIRST] the thought that [JON SNOW] would conveniently [DIE] of natural causes made her inwardly pray to the [SEVEN] for his [END] . however , [CATELYN STARK] then became horrified at herself for thinking such a thing , particularly as [JON SNOW] was an innocent child , and the person [CATELYN STARK] really hated was [JON SNOW] ['S] unidentified [MOTHER] . so she made a prayer wheel and stayed up with him all [NIGHT] , praying to the [GODS] that if they forgave her earlier wish that [JON SNOW] would [DIE] , she promised she would urge [EDDARD] to have [JON SNOW] legitimized as a [CATELYN STARK] and she would raise him as her own son . [JON SNOW] recovered , however , [CATELYN STARK] did not [KEEP] her promise . in grief at the death of her father and apparent death of her [TWO] youngest [SONS] , and her continued grief at losing [EDDARD] , [CATELYN STARK] says the [GODS] are punishing her misconduct with this war . 
not too far away in the [RIVERLANDS] , [ARYA STARK] , [GENDRY] , and [HOT PIE] are heading [NORTH] from [HARRENHAL] , planning to eventually reach the [RED FORK] of the [TRIDENT] river and then follow it west to her grandfather's [CASTLE] seat at [RIVERRUN] . off screen , [ARYA STARK] explained to the boys how [JAQEN H] ['GHAR] helped them escape because he offered that he would [KILL] any [THREE] people she named . [GENDRY] loudly criticizes [ARYA STARK] , in disbelief that she used up [TWO] of the names on minor [LANNISTER] guards when she could have said someone like king [JOFFREY] or [TYWIN LANNISTER] and [ENDED] the entire war , at which [ARYA STARK] gets quite defensive . however , as they advance in the [FOREST] , they run into a scouting party of the [BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS] , a group of outlaws , whose leader [THOROS] of [MYR] they hear singing the [RAINS] of [CASTAMERE] as they approach . they recognize them as the group the [TYWIN LANNISTER] torturers were asking about at [HARRENHAL] . [THOROS] seems a friendly sort , and they make the [CHILDREN] [COME] with them . they later give them food and drink at a local [INN] . [GENDRY] says he used to work as a smith in king's [LANDING] for tobho mott , whom [THOROS] recognizes but says he charged double what the other smiths did [GENDRY] counters that's because it was double the quality . [ARYA STARK] insists that she knows how to use a sword despite [THOROS]' disbelief , but when she tries to mock fence with him he quickly disarms her . other members of the [BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS] return to the [INN] with a captive [SANDOR] the [HOUND] [CLEGANE] . as [THOROS] trades insults with [SANDOR] , [ARYA STARK] tries to leave , but the [HOUND] stops her in astonishment and asks what in [SEVEN] hells they're doing with the [ARYA STARK] bitch , revealing her identity to all . 
finally , [JAIME LANNISTER] and [BRIENNE] of [TARTH] are slowly making their way across country through the [RIVERLANDS] , heading to king's [LANDING] intending to make the prisoner exchange for the [ARYA STARK] girls really , just [SANSA] . [JAIME LANNISTER] continues to mock [BRIENNE] along the way . [BRIENNE] is wary enough not to let [JAIME LANNISTER] out of her [SIGHT] , even insisting on keeping him on his leash and watching while he urinates so he doesn't slip away . [JAIME LANNISTER] deduces that [BRIENNE] isn't from the [NORTH] because he would have noticed her at [WINTERFELL] when he visited there , so as she is from [HOUSE TARTH] she must be a [BARATHEON] supporter . she angrily denies supporting [STANNIS] , thus confirming that she served [RENLY] . [JAIME LANNISTER] accurately deduces that she fancied [RENLY] , but points out that [RENLY] wasn't attracted to women so much as he was to [LORAS] . [BRIENNE] says she doesn't want to hear his filthy lies , but he says that he knew [RENLY] better than she did , reminding her that both of them spent the last 17 years living in the [RED KEEP] , ever since [ROBERT] ['S] [REBELLION] when [RENLY] was just a child prancing down the halls . [JAIME LANNISTER] insists that [RENLY] ['S] homosexuality was actually the worst kept secret at court if she thinks he's lying . he continues to casually mock [RENLY] which makes [BRIENNE] grab him , but he relents and says he doesn't particularly care that [RENLY] loved [LORAS] , as he feels people aren't [FREE] to choose the ones they love which he knows better than most . they [COME] across a farmer with a heavily laden mule , who notices that they're cutting cross country and avoiding the major roads , and suspects that they're avoiding soldiers . [JAIME LANNISTER] tells [BRIENNE] that he suspects the [MAN] is a scout meant to intercept them , and even if he isn't he can still spread word he saw them . he urges her to [KILL] the [MAN] , but she refuses . 
 [BRIENNE] gives [JAIME LANNISTER] a beatdown . 
later , the pair have to cross a river , which means they can either attempt a dangerous fording or take the [BRIDGE] , which will probably be watched . [BRIENNE] takes the safer route of the [BRIDGE] , but [JAIME LANNISTER] manages to distract her [LONG] enough to take away her spare sword and cut his bonds . [BRIENNE] and [JAIME LANNISTER] enter into an extended sword fight on the [BRIDGE] . [JAIME LANNISTER] starts off very aggressively , putting [BRIENNE] on the defensive . however , [JAIME LANNISTER] ['S] mobility is reduced because his hands are still manacled , and he is malnourished after having spent the past full year chained up in a cell . [JAIME LANNISTER] begins to tire , and [BRIENNE] wears him down further by making body blows with kicks and punches . after a protracted fight [JAIME LANNISTER] finally slumps to the ground in exhaustion . just then , riders from [HOUSE BOLTON] arrive led by a [MAN] named [LOCKE] . [JAIME LANNISTER] asks if they want to negotiate , but [LOCKE] says they'll have his head if he doesn't bring the kingslayer back to the king in the [NORTH] , so there's not much [JAIME LANNISTER] can do to dissuade him from taking them prisoner .

in [ASTAPOR] , [DAENERYS] , accompanied by ser [JORAH MORMONT] and ser [BARRISTAN SELMY] , walks along a [SEA] [WALL] known as the [WALK] of [PUNISHMENT] . here , any slave who showed insubordination of any type is strapped to a cross and left to [DIE] out in public , as a warning to all other slaves . [DAENERYS] offers a condemned [MAN] [WATER] , but he refuses to drink , saying he just wants to [DIE] quickly . 
 [JORAH MORMONT] and [BARRISTAN SELMY] continue to disagree on whether or not [DAENERYS] should purchase the [UNSULLIED] . [JORAH MORMONT] insists that it is their only chance to get an [ARMY] , but [BARRISTAN SELMY] believes this is not the honorable way , as slavery is illegal and abhorred in the [SEVEN KINGDOMS] . [JORAH MORMONT] claims that not only will the slave soldiers be treated better in her service , but innocent people will also be spared in war because the [UNSULLIED] only do as they are ordered . they have no human or masculine urges in their bodies , and therefore will not [KILL] civilians or rape innocent women , unlike most male soldiers who would succumb to those urges in the heat of [BATTLE] . [BARRISTAN SELMY] retorts that when her older brother [RHAEGAR] led his [ARMY] in the [BATTLE] of the [TRIDENT] , [MEN] fought and died for [RHAEGAR] because they believed in him , because they loved him not because they were slave soldiers whose [FREE FOLK] will had been stripped away . [JORAH MORMONT] responds that [RHAEGAR] indeed fought honorably and nobly , but that in the [END] [RHAEGAR] died . [DAENERYS] was born months after [ROBERT BARATHEON] killed [RHAEGAR] at the [BATTLE] of the [TRIDENT] , and only knew her cruel and half [MAD] brother [VISERYS] , so she asks ser [BARRISTAN SELMY] if he knew [RHAEGAR] . [BARRISTAN SELMY] was a member of the [TARGARYEN] [KINGSGUARD] and thus knew [RHAEGAR] well he fought beside him and bled beside him at the [TRIDENT] . [BARRISTAN SELMY] says that [RHAEGAR] was the finest [MAN] he ever met , the last dragon . [DAENERYS] grows quiet and says she wishes she'd known her older brother , but that [RHAEGAR] was not the last dragon she is . 
 [DAENERYS] speaks with [KRAZNYS] mo nakloz , as he shows her his slave soldiers , the [UNSULLIED] . he repeatedly insults and mocks [DAENERYS] in his native tongue , leaving his slave translator [MISSANDEI] of naath to clean up his crude and very insulting [DARK WORDS] into more respectful language . at one point , she pauses , wondering how to twist a particularly coarse insult from [KRAZNYS] , and [DAENERYS] notices her reluctance to directly translate . 
 [DAENERYS] says she will take all 8 , 000 [UNSULLIED] soldiers , including those in training . [KRAZNYS] laughs and retorts that she can barely afford 100 [UNSULLIED] . [DAENERYS] surprises him by telling him she has [DRAGONS] , and is willing to trade one . this offer stops [KRAZNYS] in his tracks , yet [DAENERYS] repeatedly affirms that he [MAY] only have one of her [DRAGONS] . they strike a deal that she [MAY] have all the [UNSULLIED] soldiers in exchange for her biggest dragon . both [JORAH MORMONT] and [BARRISTAN SELMY] strongly object , and plead to [DAENERYS] that while soldiers are valuable , it is [DRAGONS] that will ultimately [WIN] her the [IRON THRONE] . she ignores them , and concludes the deal with [KRAZNYS] , and also demands [MISSANDEI] as a token of [FAITH] . upon leaving the room , she scolds [JORAH MORMONT] and [BARRISTAN SELMY] , telling them that while she values their advice , they should [NEVER] again question her in public . 
 [DAENERYS] speaks with [MISSANDEI] and asks her if she has a family she says no . [DAENERYS] tells her of the [MAN] who turned down her offer of [WATER] , and asks why he would simply say , let me [DIE] . [MISSANDEI] replies that in the afterlife , there is no master . thus , the [MAN] would rather be [DEAD] than alive in the slavers [BAY] . [DAENERYS] proceeds to explain the dangers [MISSANDEI] will be facing in [DAENERYS] ['S] service and asks if that will be a problem . [MISSANDEI] simply replies , [VALAR MORGHULIS] all [MEN] must [DIE] . [DAENERYS] acknowledges the truth of the [DARK WORDS] , but quips , we are not [MEN] . .

horses' remains specially arranged by the [WHITE WALKERS] . 
the [FREE FOLK] [ARMY] of king [BEYOND] the [WALL] , [MANCE RAYDER] , including [JON SNOW] , arrive at the [FIST] of the [FIRST MEN] . they survey the bloody aftermath of assault on the [NIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] by the [WHITE WALKERS] and their [ARMY] of undead wights . [MANCE RAYDER] grimly remarks that the [WHITE WALKERS] are always the artists the severed corpses of all of the [WATCH] ['S] horses have been carefully arranged into a large scale , ceremonial spiral pattern . however , there is no sign of any human corpses which [ORELL] insists were there when he scouted ahead earlier by warging into his eagle , but have now vanished . [JON SNOW] says that there were [THREE] hundred [FIRST MEN] of the [NIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] at the [FIST] , and asks [MANCE RAYDER] if [JORAH MORMONT] could still be alive . [MANCE RAYDER] says that with [JORAH MORMONT] , it's possible he was able to escape , but that even if he did he and his [FIRST MEN] took quite a beating and are trapped miles away from the [WALL] with the [WHITE WALKERS] in close pursuit . [MANCE RAYDER] warns [JON SNOW] that all of the missing corpses from the [FIST] are no longer his friends and [BROTHERS] from the [NIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] , but have been resurrected as undead monsters who serve the [WHITE WALKERS] . 
 [MANCE RAYDER] orders [TORMUND] to take a force of twenty [FIRST MEN] to scale the [WALL] to attack [CASTLE BLACK] from its exposed rear . the fortresses of the [NIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] were purposefully built to only defend from attack over the [WALL] , [WITHOUT] defenses on their southern sides , so they wouldn't be a threat to the lords of the [SEVEN KINGDOMS] . [MANCE RAYDER] ['S] plan is for [TORMUND] ['S] [SMALL] band to distract [CASTLE BLACK] by attacking their exposed southern side , at which point [MANCE RAYDER] ['S] main [ARMY] will assault it from the [NORTH] . [TORMUND] will know that [MANCE RAYDER] is in position when his [ARMY] makes a massive signal [FIRE] [MANCE RAYDER] boasts that i'm going to make the biggest [FIRE] the [NORTH] has ever seen [MANCE RAYDER] orders [TORMUND] to take [JON SNOW] with him , as [JON SNOW] knows the layout of [CASTLE BLACK] , and it will prove a key test of his loyalty if it turns out that he won't really betray the [NIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] , [TORMUND] can easily throw him off the [WALL] to his death . 
farther [SOUTH] , lord commander [JEOR MORMONT] leads the ragged survivors of the [NIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] expedition to [CRASTER] ['S] [KEEP] . [CRASTER] mocks the survivors of the [BATTLE] of the [FIST] of the [FIRST MEN] when they reach his [KEEP] . he initially wants to refuse them shelter until he notices some of them stroking their weapons . fearful that in desperation they might try to rush him , he relents . as the [CASTLE BLACK] [BROTHERS] warm by his hearth , [CRASTER] mocks them . [CRASTER] insists that the [CASTLE BLACK] [BROTHERS] should be grateful for his generosity , and that he is a godly [MAN] for helping them . [JEOR MORMONT] tensely questions [CRASTER] ['S] claim to be a godly [MAN] , but [CRASTER] insists that he is to the real [GODS] , the [WHITE WALKERS] , who consume entire armies on their way to the [WALL] but will spare [CRASTER] for his loyalty . he admits that he's feeding his pigs better than them as pigs are valuable to him and half seriously suggests to his guests that they should eat the fat [SAMWELL TARLY] . he is also annoyed by [GILLY] ['S] loud wailing from birthing pains . [SAM] leaves the main [HOUSE] to a birthing hut where he witnesses [GILLY] giving birth with the aid of a few other women . to her horror , the baby is a [BOY] . [SAM] and [GILLY] wordlessly realize that [CRASTER] will want to sacrifice him to the [WHITE WALKERS] .

 [BRYNDEN] takes aim . 
at [RIVERRUN] in the [RIVERLANDS] , the [CASTLE BLACK] seat of [HOUSE TULLY] , the funeral of the recently deceased lord [HOSTER TULLY] is held on the banks of the [RED FORK] of the [TRIDENT] river . king [ROBB STARK] has arrived with the main force of the [NORTHERN] [ARMY] , and he helps launch his maternal grandfather's funeral boat , along with [HOSTER TULLY] ['S] younger brother [BRYNDEN] the [BLACKFISH] [HOSTER TULLY] . [CATELYN] and [ROBB STARK] ['S] [NEW] wife queen [TALISA] look on with the assembled crowd of bannermen on the dock . [HOSTER TULLY] ['S] youngest child , [CATELYN] ['S] younger brother [EDMURE] [HOSTER TULLY] , attempts to [LIGHT] the funeral boat on [FIRE] with a flaming arrow but fails [THREE] times . just as the boat is about to disappear around a bend of the river , [BRYNDEN] pushes his nephew out of the way and skillfully makes the shot . knowing his accuracy was true and the shot would hit the boat , the [BLACKFISH] turns around to [WALK] away dismissively showing up [EDMURE] at the same time as soon as he releases the arrow . 
in [CATELYN] ['S] [OLD] chamber in the [CASTLE BLACK] , she mourns with her uncle [BRYNDEN] over her father's death . she asks him if he made peace with his older brother , with whom he had been fighting for the past thirty years . [BRYNDEN] explains that he did on his deathbed [HOSTER TULLY] told him to stop calling himself the [BLACKFISH] as it was a stupid joke created over thirty years ago by [BRYNDEN] to symbolize his bad relationship with his older brother , and it wasn't very funny to begin with . [BRYNDEN] emotionally joked back to his dying brother that people had been calling him [BLACKFISH] for so [LONG] that they'd practically forgotten his real [NAME] . [CATELYN] is happy that her uncle was able to make peace with her father before he passed , and is upset that she couldn't have been there . she reminisces that she watched from this window in her childhood whenever her father left , but now he won't be [COMING] back . she tearfully wonders if her [SONS] [BRAN] and [RICKON] similarly watched at [WINTERFELL] for her return when she failed to arrive to save them . [BRYNDEN] insists that neither he nor [ROBB STARK] have given up hope that the boys [MAY] be alive and in hiding , and urges her to be strong for [ROBB STARK] . 
 [TYRION] is fascinated at [POD] ['S] ability to pleasure women . 
king [ROBB STARK] , [BRYNDEN] , and [EDMURE] confer in [RIVERRUN] ['S] meeting room . the war is not going well for them . the [LANNISTERS] have defeated their enemies in the [SOUTH] and secured king's [LANDING] from attack , as well as a marriage alliance with [HOUSE TYRELL] . they have superior numbers , wealth , and strategic position . [EDMURE] begins to speak of his recent victory at the [BATTLE] of [STONE MILL] , which pushed the [LANNISTER] [ARMY] under ser [GREGOR CLEGANE] from the [RIVERLANDS] . [ROBB STARK] and [BRYNDEN] , however , are furious with [EDMURE] their [GRAND] strategy was to lure [TYWIN] and [GREGOR CLEGANE] ['S] armies into the [WESTERLANDS] , where they would be vulnerable , out of position , and unable to defend the capital against the [BARATHEONS] . [EDMURE] ['S] role in this was to offer token defense as a feint to lure the [LANNISTERS] back west across the [RED FORK] of the [TRIDENT] . instead , by successfully attacking the [LANNISTERS] at [STONE MILL] , [EDMURE] kept them penned in the [RIVERLANDS] , and thus close enough to king's [LANDING] that [TYWIN] was able to rush to the defense of the [CITY] at the [BATTLE] of the [BLACKWATER] . the [STARKS]' strategic position in the war has been ruined . [EDMURE] insists that they took valuable captives in the [BATTLE] , [WILLEM] and [MARTYN LANNISTER] , but [ROBB STARK] angrily points out that he didn't stop fighting because his [SISTERS] are held captive . considering that [TYWIN] didn't stop to negotiate when his own eldest son was captured , taking his younger nephews hostage will have no impact on the war . [EDMURE] tries to at least point out that they lost only [TWO] hundred [MEN] at [STONE MILL] and multiple [MARTYN LANNISTER] soldiers died for every [MAN] they lost , at which [ROBB STARK] cuts him off and shouts that they need their [MEN] more than [TYWIN LANNISTER] needs his who already outnumber the [STARKS] significantly . at this point , the [LANNISTERS] are in such a good strategic position that they can afford to be patient , and grind down [ROBB STARK] ['S] forces through simple attrition . 
in the prison cells at [RIVERRUN] , queen [TALISA] bandages the minor wounds of [WILLEM] and [MARTYN LANNISTER] . they are boys , only 14 and 15 years [OLD] . one of them asks if [ROBB STARK] really transforms into a [WOLF] eats the flesh of his enemies . [TALISA] says yes but that he does not eat the flesh of [CHILDREN] , except during the full [MOON] . she asks a guard if it's currently a full [MOON] , and reassures the now terrified child that he is safe .

at king's [LANDING] , [TYWIN LANNISTER] calls the [FIRST] meeting of the [SMALL COUNCIL] since he arrived in the [CITY] and assumed his position as [HAND] of the king . he has the meeting place changed to a room next to his own quarters in the [TOWER] of the [HAND] , asserting his dominance . [TYWIN LANNISTER] arrives early and has all of the [SMALL COUNCIL] members called in at once . all of the seats are on one side of the table , as a non verbal test to see how each of them reacts around him . [PETYR] [BAELISH] ambitiously pushes his way past everyone else to be the one who sits closest to [TYWIN LANNISTER] . [VARYS] rolls his eyes at [LITTLEFINGER] ['S] naked ambition and lets him pass , content to sit in the [SECOND] closest seat for now . [GRAND] maester [PYCELLE] , who is most focused on survival by avoiding direct conflict , doesn't try to fight over a better seat with either of them , instead quietly taking the third seat away from [TYWIN LANNISTER] . [TYWIN LANNISTER] ['S] daughter [CERSEI] arrives to find the seats are all occupied , but not wanting to play that [GAME] and be relegated to a lowly position , she pulls up a chair so she is sitting at [TYWIN LANNISTER] ['S] right [HAND] , opposite [LITTLEFINGER] . [TYRION] is the only one who even mildly stands up to [TYWIN LANNISTER] ['S] posturing , by not even trying to sit closest to [TYWIN LANNISTER] instead he takes a [NEW] chair and makes a point of noisily dragging it across the ground until it is positioned at the exact opposite [END] of the table from his father . 
 [TYWIN LANNISTER] is upset with the [THREE] advisors , noting that between them , they possess the greatest number of spies in the world , yet none of them can locate his son [JAIME] , even though the entire [NORTHERN] [ARMY] has heard of his escape . [TYWIN LANNISTER] asks what news there is of the war , and [VARYS] reports that [ROBB STARK] has taken the bulk of his [ARMY] to [RIVERRUN] for his grandfather's funeral , while leaving lord [ROOSE BOLTON] in command of [HARRENHAL] . [VARYS] makes a jab at [LITTLEFINGER] ['S] recent , titular promotion as lord of [HARRENHAL] , noting that this makes [ROOSE BOLTON] the current lord of [HARRENHAL] in practice if not in [NAME] . however , [TYWIN LANNISTER] says that [ROOSE BOLTON] can [KEEP] it , because the title alone is enough to give [LITTLEFINGER] the social standing to be a suitor to lady [LYSA ARRYN] . [LITTLEFINGER] states that they have known each other since childhood , and [LYSA ARRYN] has always adored him , and thus she will soon remarry to him . [PYCELLE] notes that this will make [LITTLEFINGER] the acting lord paramount of the [VALE] , an even more important position [BAELISH] is even wearing a more expensive tunic than usual , laced with gold , to reflect his [NEW] status . . 
 [THEON] is nearly raped by his torturer . 
 [TYWIN LANNISTER] states that this will confirm that the [VALE] of [LYSA ARRYN] , which has been neutral in the war up to now , will not support [ROBB STARK] , who is increasingly being hemmed in by enemies other marriage alliances , with [HOUSE TYRELL] of the reach and [HOUSE MARTELL] of [DORNE] , combined with the crushing of the [BARATHEONS] , have in turn secured the rest of southern [WESTEROS] under [TYWIN LANNISTER] control . [TYRION] points out that if [BAELISH] departs for the [VALE] that leaves a vacancy on the [SMALL COUNCIL] , and [TYWIN LANNISTER] reveals that he has appointed [TYRION] as the [NEW] master of coin to replace him . while this [MAY] seem like giving [TYRION] a position of relative power again , [TYRION] quickly points out that he has no prior experience in finance . with backhanded compliments , [CERSEI] makes it clear that this promotion is really intended to give him an opportunity to make mistakes he will be blamed for . 
after the meeting , [TYRION] , [PODRICK] [PAYNE] , and ser bronn drop by [LITTLEFINGER] ['S] office in his brothel , where he keeps his ledgers . [POD] loads them all into a cart as ros flirts with him . [LITTLEFINGER] says it was the safest place to [KEEP] such records , but [TYRION] notes that his brothel hasn't been the safest place for [BASTARDS] . [BAELISH] says he hopes [TYRION] does well in the position , as he owes him for securing the release of ros after [CERSEI] arrested her , mistaking her for [SHAE] but [TYRION] says it was just a misunderstanding . [TYRION] and bronn then lead [POD] into another room of the brothel , where [TYRION] says that he wants to reward him for saving his life during the [BATTLE] of the [BLACKWATER] he has paid for [PODRICK] who has [NEVER] had sex with a [WOMAN] to enjoy the services of not one , but [THREE] prostitutes marei , genna , and a contortionist named kayla one of only four women in the world who can properly perform a meereenese knot . 
later , [TYRION] is reading through the financial records , and explains to bronn that not all is as [BAELISH] would like the court to think . bronn asks if he thinks [LITTLEFINGER] has been stealing to obtain the [CROWN] ['S] money , but [TYRION] says the problem is more that he's been borrowing all of it . [LITTLEFINGER] always acted like he was a financial genius who could raise money seemingly out of nowhere , but in reality the [IRON THRONE] is heavily in debt , and [LITTLEFINGER] procured enough money to balance the books every year by borrowing massive sums of money from foreign banks . . 
 [BRIENNE] is beaten down as the captors prepare to rape her . 
in particular , much of their debt is owed to the [IRON BANK] of [BRAAVOS] , the largest [IRON BANK] in the [FREE CITIES] . [TYRION] warns bronn that when debtors to the [IRON BANK] can not repay their loans , the [IRON BANK] will [FIRST] refuse to give out [NEW] loans , and ultimately support rebellions against them . [TYRION] fears that if they can't repay the debt , the [IRON BANK] will eventually cut them off and start supporting [ROBB STARK] or [STANNIS BARATHEON] . [PODRICK] then returns , with the money [TYRION] gave him to pay the prostitutes . [TYRION] is concerned that he lost heart and fled , but [POD] innocently says he did all sorts of [THINGS] with the prostitutes they simply refused his offer of payment . impressed that the women would provide their services for [FREE CITIES] , [TYRION] and bronn ask [POD] to explain in detail what transpired , so they can take copious notes . 
at [DRAGONSTONE] , king [STANNIS BARATHEON] speaks with [MELISANDRE] as she prepares to depart by boat . he is worried that his enemies think he is defeated and are laughing at him , and that now even she is abandoning him . she assures him that she still thinks he is the lord's chosen , but she must travel to the [RIVERLANDS] to obtain something vital for his cause . [STANNIS BARATHEON] says that he wants her , and that he wants [JOFFREY] and [ROBB STARK] [DEAD] , and asks her to make a son again with him like the [SHADOW] creature she conjured to assassinate [RENLY] . [MELISANDRE] says that she can not creating a [SHADOW] creature drains some of the [FIRE] of a [WOMAN] ['S] life force , and she fears that creating another would [KILL] [STANNIS BARATHEON] . over his protests , she explains that what she is seeking is even more powerful than a [SHADOW] creature , and will change his fortunes in this war , but she needs a king's [BLOOD] to do it . [STANNIS BARATHEON] doesn't understand , but [MELISANDRE] implies that she needs to burn a human sacrifice who possesses a king's [BLOOD] as an offering to the lord of [LIGHT] . she can't [KILL] [STANNIS BARATHEON] himself to achieve this , but as she points out , there are others with your [BLOOD] in their veins any of his brother king [ROBERT] ['S] bastard [CHILDREN] who managed to survive the purge . 
at the [INN] at the [CROSSROADS] in the [RIVERLANDS] , [ARYA STARK] , [GENDRY] , and [HOT PIE] are still in the company of the [BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS] , who are preparing to depart . [GENDRY] has finished fixing a steel breastplate which [THOROS] puts on , and [ARYA STARK] asks why [GENDRY] is helping them . [THOROS] says that they're not prisoners , it's just that the war torn [RIVERLANDS] aren't a safe place for [NED STARK] ['S] daughter . [ARYA STARK] notices that they are loading [SANDOR] the [HOUND] [CLEGANE] into a prisoner cart , so she walks over and angrily asks him if he [REMEMBERS] the last time he was here , but he simply says all poor inns look the same . . 
 [JAIME] loses his sword [HAND] . 
as they get ready to leave , [HOT PIE] explains that he isn't going with them he baked some bread for the innkeeper , and as he was a baker's apprentice when he lived in king's [LANDING] , the innkeeper thought it was the best bread they'd ever had , and offered him a job . this life of fighting and travelling isn't really for him , plus [THOROS] formally made a deal with the innkeeper to pay for the [FREE CITIES] meals they enjoyed with [HOT PIE] ['S] services . before they go , he gives [ARYA STARK] a present he made for her a loaf of bread shaped like a direwolf , though [ARYA STARK] implies the tail looks like a head . [ARYA STARK] is a bit brusque but the [THREE] wish each other well as they depart , and as they are riding away [ARYA STARK] starts eating the [WOLF] bread , and turns back to shout to [HOT PIE] that it is very good . 
at an undisclosed location , [THEON GREYJOY] escapes from the dungeon with the help of a young [WOMAN] , who gives him a horse and tells him to ride east . [THEON GREYJOY] thanks him and says he'll make him a lord of the [IRON ISLANDS] for this , but the [BOY] says that they aren't in the [IRON ISLANDS] now . [THEON GREYJOY] is later hunted down by his captors in a prolonged chase on horseback through the woods . ultimately his pursuers split into [TWO] groups and trap [THEON GREYJOY] between them , and he is knocked off his horse with a flail . [THEON GREYJOY] ['S] captors pin him to the ground , and pull down his pants the leader declares that he intends to rape [THEON GREYJOY] as [PUNISHMENT] for trying to run away . however , [THEON GREYJOY] ['S] unidentified savior returns and snipes all of the captors from afar using his bow , rescuing him at the last minute . 
somewhere else in the [RIVERLANDS] , [JAIME LANNISTER] and [BRIENNE] of [TARTH] have been taken captive by [LOCKE] and a detachment of [MEN] from [HOUSE BOLTON] . as they ride along , the [MEN] sing a rousing chorus of the [BEAR] and the [MAIDEN FAIR] . tied up back to back on one of the horses , [JAIME LANNISTER] warns [BRIENNE] that when they make camp for the [NIGHT] , they will rape her , more than once , and that his honest advice is to give no resistance , and just think of [RENLY] . they were only sent to capture [JAIME LANNISTER] , therefore [BRIENNE] means nothing to them , so at the slightest provocation they will [KILL] her [BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS] hesitation . [BRIENNE] says she will fight even if they [KILL] her , and [JAIME LANNISTER] agrees that if he were a [WOMAN] , he would fight to the death before being raped , too . 
later that [NIGHT] [LOCKE] ['S] [MEN] make camp , and do indeed drag [BRIENNE] kicking and screaming into the bushes to gang rape her . [JAIME LANNISTER] is disgusted by this pointless brutality , so he points out to [LOCKE] that [BRIENNE] is actually a noblewoman and the sole heir of lord [SELWYN] of [TARTH] , the sapphire isle , and her father will pay them a ransom of her weight in sapphires provided that she is unharmed . [LOCKE] agrees and calls his [MEN] back before they are able to rape [BRIENNE] , and they tie her up to a tree again . [JAIME LANNISTER] tries to smooth talk [LOCKE] once again with offers of how his father [TYWIN] will make him extravagantly rich if he lets [JAIME LANNISTER] go . tiring of [JAIME LANNISTER] ['S] frequent attempts to bribe him into turning over to the [JAIME LANNISTER] side , [LOCKE] decides to prove that [JAIME LANNISTER] ['S] father will [NEVER] deal with the likes of him . at [FIRST] [LOCKE] has his [MEN] untie [JAIME LANNISTER] on the pretext of letting him go , but then his [MEN] [HOLD] him down on a chopping block while [LOCKE] grabs a carving knife , threatening to stab [JAIME LANNISTER] in the eye . [LOCKE] reasons that maiming [TYWIN] ['S] son will be the ultimate proof that the [LANNISTERS] would [NEVER] deal with [LOCKE] , much less bribe him . [LOCKE] says that [JAIME LANNISTER] ['S] father can't help him now , and this should help you remember as he swings down the carving knife and hacks off [JAIME LANNISTER] ['S] sword [HAND] . for half a [SECOND] , [JAIME LANNISTER] stares at his severed right [HAND] in shock , before what just happened can register in his mind and then he begins to scream in horror .

in the [RIVERLANDS] , [JAIME LANNISTER] has had his sword [HAND] cut off by [LOCKE] . the following day , [LOCKE] ['S] [FIRST MEN] lead their prisoners [JAIME LANNISTER] and [BRIENNE] of [TARTH] back to [HARRENHAL] on horseback . [LOCKE] is gaining maximum enjoyment from torturing someone who can't possibly fight back he ties [JAIME LANNISTER] ['S] severed right [HAND] onto a rope and hangs it around [JAIME LANNISTER] ['S] [NECK] , forcing [JAIME LANNISTER] to smell as the flesh of his own [HAND] rots . [JAIME LANNISTER] is physically in agony from his wound , feverish and half delirious . [JAIME LANNISTER] can barely stay conscious , and he falls headlong off of his horse into the [MUD] . [LOCKE] has been tormenting [JAIME LANNISTER] by not giving him [WATER] and he is almost dying of thirst . one of [LOCKE] ['S] [FIRST MEN] moves to give him [WATER] but instead empties the canteen over [JAIME LANNISTER] ['S] head to taunt him . [JAIME LANNISTER] weakly tries to point out that if he actually dies [LOCKE] and his [FIRST MEN] will be in serious trouble , but [LOCKE] simply dismisses this . [LOCKE] then hands him a container , which he desperately guzzles down rapidly , too weak to notice what it is . [LOCKE] then points out that he filled the container with horse piss just to torment [JAIME LANNISTER] , who spits out what he can . [JAIME LANNISTER] can barely move , but [LOCKE] viciously kicks him repeatedly . in a surge of effort [JAIME LANNISTER] manages to steal the sword from one of [LOCKE] ['S] [FIRST MEN] , but [JAIME LANNISTER] is so weak and feverish that he can barely stand , much less wield a sword and he can not fight as well with his left [HAND] as he could his sword [HAND] . [JAIME LANNISTER] soon realizes this , and actually isn't trying to fight them off any more , but instead to provoke one of them to [KILL] him so he doesn't have to go on living like this and can [DIE] with the [SMALL] dignity of having a sword in his [HAND] . he succumbs to exhaustion and [LOCKE] doesn't even bother to punish him this time , just warning him that if he tries that again he'll cut off his other [HAND] . 
later that [NIGHT] [JAIME LANNISTER] and [BRIENNE] are restrained near a campfire . [JAIME LANNISTER] refuses to eat , and says he wants to [DIE] . [BRIENNE] says he should try to live for revenge , but [JAIME LANNISTER] says he was that [HAND] , and [WITHOUT] his sword [HAND] , even if he escapes , he is nothing , and would rather [DIE] as the [JAIME LANNISTER] he was than go on living , robbed of his very identity . [BRIENNE] grows angry , insinuating to [JAIME LANNISTER] that this is the [FIRST MEN] time he's had to face the real world where [THINGS] people care about get taken away , but he's pathetically moping around like a [WOMAN] . her criticism and strength convinces [JAIME LANNISTER] to start eating . [BRIENNE] says she overheard when he earlier managed to talk [LOCKE] out of letting his [FIRST MEN] gang rape her , by convincing him that her father will pay [LOCKE] her weight in sapphires . while [BRIENNE] is a noblewoman and worth a ransom , [TARTH] is called the sapphire isle due to the color of the [SEAS] around it , not because there are any actual sapphires , and [HOUSE TARTH] is not particularly rich . [BRIENNE] is completely confused , and asks [JAIME LANNISTER] why he helped her , but he doesn't answer . 
 [VARYS]' [LONG] awaited revenge . 
in king's [LANDING] , [TYRION LANNISTER] meets with [VARYS] , who is in the middle of prying open a large wooden crate . [TYRION LANNISTER] asks [VARYS] to help him confirm who sent ser [MANDON MOORE] to [KILL] him during the [BATTLE] of the [BLACKWATER] . [VARYS] says he would like to help , but the most he has are whispers that it was [CERSEI] , but only whispers , and he can not confirm who gave the order . [TYRION LANNISTER] wants to know with certainty if it was his sister so he can take revenge . [VARYS] uses this opportunity to finish a conversation they were having on the eve of the [BATTLE] , in which [VARYS] promised to reveal how he was castrated . [VARYS] says that he used to be a slave in a travelling troupe that passed through all of the [FREE CITIES] , but once when he was in [MYR] he was sold to a sorcerer . the sorcerer gave him a potion which temporarily paralyzed him while still leaving him fully aware and able to experience pain , and then he cut his genitals off , root and stem shaft and testes . the sorcerer needed his genitals as a sacrifice for a spell , and he burned [VARYS]' genitals in a brazier of [FIRE] . what [VARYS] has had recurrent nightmares about to this day is not the sorcerer , or the knife , or the pain ... but that when the sorcerer prayed to the blue flames in his ceremony , a voice clearly answered him from the flames . whether it was a [GOD] or a demon or simply parlor tricks , [VARYS] [NEVER] knew , as the sorcerer threw him out into the street to [DIE] . but he was determined to live , to spite the sorcerer , and one day get his revenge on him . [VARYS] did whatever it took to claw his way up into a position of influence in the world [FIRST MEN] , to survive he would beg , steal , or sell the sexual use of the parts of his body he still had . increasingly , he discovered that stealing [FIRST MEN] ['S] secrets was far more profitable than anything physical which could be stolen , and in time , he worked his way up from the slums of [MYR] to the [SMALL COUNCIL] in king's [LANDING] . this is why [VARYS] has always hated those who claim to wield magical powers , and particularly why he opposed [STANNIS BARATHEON] , who relies on the [RED PRIESTESS] [MELISANDRE] . as [VARYS] finishes his [LONG] tale , he finally finishes prying the last nail out of the crate and opens it . to [TYRION LANNISTER] ['S] astonishment , it contains an elderly sorcerer , the very same one that castrated [VARYS] so many years ago . he is still alive but gagged , and was shipped to [VARYS] in the crate . using his own life as an example , [VARYS] thus urges [TYRION LANNISTER] to be patient , and his revenge will [COME] to him in time . [VARYS] then closes the crate , with the sorcerer still inside . 
 [VARYS] visits ros , who has been secretly spying on [LITTLEFINGER] for him . he is surprised to hear her report from the other prostitutes in the brothel on the prodigious activities of one [PODRICK] [PAYNE] . [VARYS] is perplexed as to what exactly happened ros says the girls told her he wasn't particularly large or anything , so much as what he did , but when she repeatedly asked them what exactly that was , the most they could say is that it was hard to describe . she then reports on how frequently [LITTLEFINGER] has visited [SANSA STARK] , and says she thinks he is obsessed with her , and wants to smuggle her out of the [CITY] . he asks why she thinks this is true , and she presents a stolen copy of the ship's manifest for the boat that will take [LITTLEFINGER] to the [VALE] . [VARYS] is surprised that ros is literate and asks what obvious point it is that he doesn't see . she points out that there will be [TWO] feather beds , and [VARYS] realizes [LITTLEFINGER] would only pay the extra money for someone other than [LITTLEFINGER] if it was [SANSA STARK] . 
 [CERSEI] and [OLENNA] in the [GREAT SEPT] of [BAELOR] . [JOFFREY] and [MARGAERY] wave at the pleased crowd . [JOFFREY] gives [MARGAERY] a tour of the [GREAT SEPT] of [BAELOR] , where their royal [WEDDING] is to be held , as [CERSEI LANNISTER] and [OLENNA TYRELL] follow . [JOFFREY] excitedly relates tales of the darker chapters of the [GREAT SEPT] ['S] history , to [MARGAERY] ['S] feigned interest and [CERSEI LANNISTER] ['S] annoyance . [OLENNA TYRELL] asks if [ROBERT BARATHEON] was buried with the [TARGARYEN] [KINGS] in the [GREAT SEPT] [CERSEI LANNISTER] explains that he left instructions to return his remains to [STORM] ['S] [END] . when [CERSEI LANNISTER] dismisses the accident that claimed [ROBERT BARATHEON] ['S] life , [OLENNA TYRELL] laments her son's total lack of military prowess . [CERSEI LANNISTER] points out that [OLENNA TYRELL] ['S] son lord [MACE] [OLENNA TYRELL] besieged [STORM] ['S] [END] for almost a full year during [ROBERT BARATHEON] ['S] [REBELLION] , but [OLENNA TYRELL] scoffs that her oaf of a son is no warrior and the only thing he laid [SIEGE] to was the banquet table in the command tent . [OLENNA TYRELL] muses on the shortcomings of the [FIRST MEN] in their lives and the arrangement of patriarchy in general , to which [CERSEI LANNISTER] wistfully says that it is the will of the [GODS] . thus distracted , [MARGAERY] convinces [JOFFREY] to greet the crowd [OUTSIDE] . having been somewhat placated by [MARGAERY] ['S] charity , the crowd happily cheers for the pair of them . [CERSEI LANNISTER] realizes she has lost control of [JOFFREY] to the [TYRELLS] . 
subsequently , [CERSEI LANNISTER] meets with her father [TYWIN] in his chambers . she wants to ensure that he is doing everything he can to find [JAIME] . [TYWIN] dismissively points out that he started a war when his hated dwarf son [TYRION LANNISTER] was captured by the [STARKS] , so assuredly he is willing to do even more now for his elder son . [TYWIN] makes it clear that he considers [JAIME] his heir despite the fact that as a [KINGSGUARD] member , [JAIME] has officially renounced all rights to inheritance . [TYRION LANNISTER] previously noted that he is next in line of succession after [JAIME] , as a younger son inherits before an older daughter , but [TYWIN] said he would [NEVER] let his hated dwarf son be his heir . [CERSEI LANNISTER] points out that as she is next in line of succession maybe [TYWIN] should consider her the real heir to his legacy , not his [SONS] . she claims she is the only one of his [CHILDREN] who ever took his lectures on family and legacy seriously . she points out that for a [MAN] who pays a lot of lip service to family and legacy , he excludes her from his plans . [TYWIN] confirms that he excludes [CERSEI LANNISTER] from his plans , but not because she is a [WOMAN] he distrusts her because she isn't nearly as smart as she thinks she is . he sneers that she has allowed [JOFFREY] to run roughshod over her , the [CITY] and its people , and that he intends to rein in his grandson's deranged behavior . [CERSEI LANNISTER] says she is afraid of the growing influence of the [TYRELLS] at court , and something must be done about them . in particular , [CERSEI LANNISTER] is nervous about how skilled [MARGAERY TYRELL] is at manipulating [JOFFREY] . [TYWIN] bluntly responds that it's good someone has finally been able to manipulate [JOFFREY] , as [CERSEI LANNISTER] herself has clearly proven to be incapable of doing it . she says [TYWIN] should try stopping [JOFFREY] from doing what he likes implying he will find it extremely difficult , but her father firmly responds , i will . . 
 [VARYS] and [OLENNA TYRELL] discuss [SANSA STARK] meanwhile , [OLENNA TYRELL] is seated in the [GARDENS] with [TWO] of [MARGAERY TYRELL] ['S] cousins . one of them embroiders a [GOLDEN] [MARGAERY TYRELL] [ROSE] with their motto , growing strong , which prompts [OLENNA TYRELL] to complain that their family has the dullest sigil and motto in the [SEVEN KINGDOMS] . other families have interesting mottos like [WINTER] is [COMING] or we do not sow , and have direwolves and krakens for sigils . [VARYS] arrives to meet with [OLENNA TYRELL] and she shoos the girls away . they [WALK] through the [GARDENS] , and while [OLENNA TYRELL] remains relatively polite she instantly sees through all of [VARYS]' pleasantries . [VARYS] is verbally outmatched , for once , and she asks him to just get to the point . he says that he is extremely worried that [LITTLEFINGER] is going to try to take control of [SANSA STARK] with [ROBB STARK] ['S] younger [BROTHERS] presumed [DEAD] at [WINTERFELL] , and [ARYA STARK] missing and presumed [DEAD] for over a year , [SANSA STARK] is [ROBB STARK] ['S] only heir . the war of the [FIVE KINGS] is not going well for the [STARKS] now , and if [ROBB STARK] were to be defeated and [DIE] , the [WOMAN] who controls [SANSA STARK] controls the [NORTH] . [VARYS] says that while he enjoys sparring with [BAELISH] , he is truly horrified by the [WOMAN] . while they are all engaged in the intrigues and murders of court politics , [BAELISH] has utterly no limits on what he will do to achieve power he would burn the entire [REALM] down if it meant he could be king of the ashes . [OLENNA TYRELL] agrees and says that the solution is rather obvious . 
shortly thereafter , [MARGAERY TYRELL] finds [SANSA STARK] praying in the [RED KEEP] ['S] godswood , overlooking [BLACKWATER] [BAY] . she dismisses the [CERSEI LANNISTER] guards threatening to tell the king they refused her if they don't leave and engages in pleasant [SMALL] talk . [MARGAERY TYRELL] plays a [SMALL] joke on [SANSA STARK] by saying that her cousin died of a pox which made her face melt off , but is just trying to brighten her spirits though in the process is reminded that [SANSA STARK] is still somewhat na ve . [MARGAERY TYRELL] then invites [SANSA STARK] to visit [HIGHGARDEN] in the reach someday . [SANSA STARK] is confused , as queen [CERSEI LANNISTER] won't allow her to leave the [CITY] , but [MARGAERY TYRELL] wryly points out that queen regent [CERSEI LANNISTER] might not want her to , but queen [MARGAERY TYRELL] would be happy to share [HIGHGARDEN] ['S] pageantry with a friend ... or a sister . [MARGAERY TYRELL] points out that if [SANSA STARK] were to marry [LORAS] , then she would belong in [HIGHGARDEN] anyway . the thought of finally escaping [JOFFREY] , being wed to her idol and becoming a [MARGAERY TYRELL] makes [SANSA STARK] choke out tears of joy . 
the [HOUND] is brought before the [BROTHERHOOD] to answer for his crimes . elsewhere in the [RIVERLANDS] , [ARYA STARK] and [GENDRY] are kept hooded as [THOROS] of [MYR] and his [MEN] lead them into a cave , hollow hill , which serves as the secret hideout of the [BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS] . [SANDOR] the [HOUND] [CLEGANE] is brought with them in restraints , and is confronted by the leader of the [BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS] , ser [BERIC] [DONDARRION] . ser [BERIC] was commanded by none other than [EDDARD STARK] to lead a group of soldiers to track down and bring to justice the false [KNIGHT] ser [GREGOR CLEGANE] , when he started raiding the [RIVERLANDS] under [TYWIN LANNISTER] ['S] orders at the very beginning of the war of the [FIVE KINGS] . they subsequently became trapped behind [TYWIN LANNISTER] lines , but continued to harass their forces by forming the [BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS] . over time , however , they began to realize how much suffering was being inflicted on the smallfolk of the [RIVERLANDS] by [EDDARD STARK] and [TYWIN LANNISTER] forces alike , and began to defend the commoners from raiders from both sides of the war . over time they were joined by [EDDARD STARK] deserters , [BARATHEON] deserters , and commoners who want to defend their homes . 
 [DONDARRION] says he's still following the mission that [EDDARD STARK] set him on , to bring [GREGOR CLEGANE] to justice and restore king [ROBERT] ['S] peace to the [RIVERLANDS] . the [HOUND] balks that [EDDARD STARK] and [ROBERT] are [DEAD] now , and he can't just be fighting for ghosts , but [DONDARRION] says that now the [BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS] are ghosts , attacking the [LANNISTERS] where they least expect them , melting away back to their hideouts in the woods . the [BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS] points out that the [TYWIN LANNISTER] lions have been butchering the innocent . at the outbreak of the war , [DONDARRION] ['S] group were ambushed in the [BATTLE] at the [MUMMER] ['S] [FORD] , where girls as young as [SEVEN] were raped and babies were cut in half in front of their parents . [SANDOR] points out that he wasn't at [MUMMER] ['S] [FORD] . the [BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS] continues to cite various [TYWIN LANNISTER] crimes [THOROS] says he was there during the [SACK] of king's [LANDING] and saw the butchered corpses of the royal [CHILDREN] , rhaenys and [AEGON] [TARGARYEN] . [SANDOR] continues to point out that he wasn't present for these crimes and many of them were in fact committed by his older brother [GREGOR CLEGANE] who personally killed the baby [AEGON] , then raped and killed his [MOTHER] [ELIA] . [SANDOR] says that they can't [KILL] him for the crime of being born into [HOUSE CLEGANE] and being related to [GREGOR CLEGANE] . he also scoffs at how [DONDARRION] and many of his [MEN] have converted to the lord of [LIGHT] religion , of which [THOROS] is a priest . [ARYA STARK] then speaks up , and angrily accuses [SANDOR] of killing her friend [MYCAH] , the butcher's [BOY] , then slinging his corpse over his horse like a deer . [SANDOR] matter of factly admits that he killed [MYCAH] , but says he was in no place to question then [PRINCE] [JOFFREY] ['S] orders . the [BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS] , closing in on something [SANDOR] actually did , charge him with the crime of following orders to [KILL] [MYCAH] , but that they will give him a [FAIR] trial [DONDARRION] himself will face [SANDOR] in a trial by combat .

in the [NORTH] , [BRAN STARK] is having a shared greensight dream with [JOJEN] [REED] . they are walking through the woods and see the [THREE EYED RAVEN] again . [JOJEN] advises [BRAN STARK] that he must follow the [THREE EYED RAVEN] , and when he is confused , [JOJEN] points out that he must follow it by climbing a tree . [BRAN STARK] begins to [CLIMB] the tree that the [THREE EYED RAVEN] has landed in but he soon becomes terrified , remembering the fall that crippled him when he was climbing a [TOWER] at [WINTERFELL] . he sees a vivid dream memory of his [MOTHER] [CATELYN] , repeating her warning in which she made him promise [NEVER] to [CLIMB] again a promise which he broke , and thus indirectly led to the fall which crippled him . [BRAN STARK] is so terrified of the memory of [CATELYN] yelling at him that he falls off the tree . [BRAN STARK] and [JOJEN] wake in their camp in the woods , disappointed that he could not follow the [THREE EYED RAVEN] . 
elsewhere , apparently in the [NORTH] , [THEON GREYJOY] is being led by the [BOY] who set him [FREE] from the dungeon and then rescued him by killing his captors when they tried to recapture him . he says that he is leading [THEON GREYJOY] to [DEEPWOOD MOTTE] , a [CASTLE] on the west coast of the [NORTH] which was captured by his sister [YARA] . he says he is concerned that some of the guards [MAY] betray [THEON GREYJOY] , so it is best to sneak into the [CASTLE] through the drains until they reach his sister in person . as the [BOY] fumbles around with keys at a locked [GATE] , [THEON GREYJOY] sinks to the ground and asks if his father [BALON] knows he was taken captive the [BOY] says he doesn't know but [THEON GREYJOY] says he probably did but left him for [DEAD] . filled with remorse , [THEON GREYJOY] laments that his real father died when his head was cut off in king's [LANDING] , that he had a choice between [TWO] families , and he chose wrong . [THEON GREYJOY] says that now , he has destroyed everything he ever cared about , and his real [HOME] [WINTERFELL] is burned to the ground . he also says the only thing he ever resented about [ROBB STARK] is that [ROBB STARK] could effortlessly be the kind of good [MAN] that [THEON GREYJOY] truly wanted to be but had to struggle against his own failings to be like . [THEON GREYJOY] even apologizes aloud for having [TWO] innocent orphan boys killed , so in desperation he could pass them off as [BRAN STARK] and [RICKON] [BRAN STARK] . the [BOY] is surprised , and [THEON GREYJOY] explains to him that [BRAN STARK] and [RICKON] escaped , so he had to fake their deaths so he wouldn't seem weak . 
the [BOY] leads [THEON GREYJOY] into a [DARK] chamber in the [CASTLE] , and he calls out for [YARA] . the [BOY] then lights a torch ... revealing the same x shaped cross that [THEON GREYJOY] was chained to when he was being tortured before . [THEON GREYJOY] was led in a complete circle , back to the very same dungeon he escaped from in the [FIRST] place . other guards [COME] in and the [BOY] shouts to tie [THEON GREYJOY] up again , where he belongs , and that it was [THEON GREYJOY] who killed the other guards when he tried to escape instead of him . the [BOY] , giving commands , is revealed to be one of the head torturers , and [THEON GREYJOY] ['S] entire escape that he led him on was nothing more than another form of torture , sadistically toying with him .

at [CRASTER] ['S] [KEEP] , tensions run [HIGH] among the members of the [NIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] who sought shelter there after escaping the devastating defeat at the [BATTLE] of the [FIST] of the [FIRST MEN] . [GRENN] and edd are shoveling pig shit , but the former rapist [RAST] urges them that they are not safe here and can not trust [CRASTER] the [MAN] sacrifices his own newborn [SONS] to the [WHITE WALKERS] , and there's every probability that if the [WHITE WALKERS] do [COME] , he'll [HAND] over the [NIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] survivors to his real [MASTERS] . [GRENN] and edd don't want to discuss it . 
 [SAMWELL TARLY] visits [GILLY] , who is deeply distraught about the fate of her newborn son . she is frantic , and yells at [SAM] not to draw attention to the fact that it's a [BOY] by calling it a he so loud , as [CRASTER] will want to offer it up as a sacrifice when he finds out it's a son . he asks her if she's decided on a [NAME] , but she responds that there's no point in naming her baby if he's only going to be offered up as a human sacrifice . she gives [SAM] back his [MOTHER] ['S] thimble and says she doesn't care about such stupid [THINGS] , all she's focused on is protecting the life of her baby . 
some of their wounded have died from their injuries , and lord commander [JEOR MORMONT] leads a funeral service as they burn the corpse of a [MAN] named bannen on a pyre . [JEOR MORMONT] didn't know the [MAN] well , but he rode bravely into the unknown [LANDS] far [BEYOND] the [WALL] , fought valiantly at the [FIST] against monsters which they didn't even know existed , and they will [NEVER] see a [MAN] that brave again . he closes the eulogy with the traditional closing line for members of the [NIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] , and now , his [WATCH] is [ENDED] , which the assembled [FIRST MEN] repeat . 
in the main [HALL] , lord commander [JEOR MORMONT] is checking a map in his journal , as [CRASTER] continues to crassly berate the [FIRST MEN] of the [NIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] . [JEOR MORMONT] says that they have to stay [LONG] enough for their wounded to recover sufficiently to be fit to travel , but [CRASTER] waves this off , saying they've recovered as much as they ever will . [CRASTER] openly suggests that they should just [KILL] the [FIRST MEN] who are so severely wounded that they won't be able to travel , and if [JEOR MORMONT] is reluctant to do the deed himself , he can just leave and [CRASTER] will finish them off . [JEOR MORMONT] declines . another young [NIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] [MAN] , [KARL] tanner , comes in to complain that [CRASTER] is feeding them nothing but bread cut with sawdust , and he wants to know where [CRASTER] keeps his hidden larder . meanwhile , [CRASTER] is sitting there getting quite drunk on the wine they gifted to him when they [FIRST MEN] came . [RAST] joins in the accusations , and [CRASTER] admits that he has [WINTER] stockpiles , but he needs those to feed his women and refuses to share them . [RAST] calls [CRASTER] a bastard at which [CRASTER] becomes enraged and threatens [RAST] with an axe . [JEOR MORMONT] restrains [RAST] , and [CRASTER] shouts that he's throwing them all out to lie down [OUTSIDE] in the cold on their empty bellies . [CRASTER] says he will chop the hands off the next [MAN] who calls him bastard . a tense moment of silence passes , and [JEOR MORMONT] grabs [RAST] to lead him out the doorway . 
 [CRASTER] is murdered . ... when [KARL] , firmly staring directly at [CRASTER] , challenges him and calls him a daughter fucking , wildling bastard , [CRASTER] lunges forward at [KARL] in a blind rage , but he is drunk and clumsy [WITHOUT] flinching , [KARL] holds off [CRASTER] ['S] axe with his left [HAND] , while using his right [HAND] to ram a dagger through the [OLD] [MAN] ['S] throat , which goes up into the roof of his mouth . he flings the dying [CRASTER] to the ground , then punches one of [CRASTER] ['S] wives who is present , demanding to know where the hidden food is kept . lord commander [JEOR MORMONT] bellows that the [GODS] will curse him for this , as a guest killing a host who has formally accepted him into his [HOME] breaks all the [LAWS] of [GODS] and [FIRST MEN] . [KARL] shouts that there are no [LAWS] [BEYOND] the [WALL] . [KARL] continues to threaten the girl with a knife , so [JEOR MORMONT] draws his sword , which makes [KARL] drop the girl and begin to face off against [JEOR MORMONT] with his dagger . suddenly , [RAST] comes up behind [JEOR MORMONT] and literally stabs the lord commander in the back , which makes [JEOR MORMONT] drop his sword . for a brief moment the [FIRST MEN] stare in shock , then [GRENN] charges and tackles [KARL] . the entire room explodes into pure bedlam . 
the desperate [NIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] recruits like [RAST] , mostly conscripted criminals exiled to the [WALL] , turn on officers who are loyal to [JEOR MORMONT] , as well as some of the other common recruits like [GRENN] who stay loyal . quick flashes of the fight go by as no one can really perceive what's happening , and the mutiny spreads throughout [CRASTER] ['S] [KEEP] . in the midst of it , [JEOR MORMONT] turns around to fight off [RAST] . [JEOR MORMONT] [MAY] have a knife in his back but he is twice [RAST] ['S] size and completely enraged . [JEOR MORMONT] grabs [RAST] by the throat and lifts him off his feet , one handed , then spins him around and hurls him against the opposite [WALL] . still choking [RAST] , [JEOR MORMONT] nearly succeeds in crushing [RAST] ['S] windpipe with his bare [HAND] but then [JEOR MORMONT] starts to cough up thick [RED] [BLOOD] . his knife wound is mortal . the injured [JEOR MORMONT] then sinks to the ground and continues to cough up [BLOOD] . now that [JEOR MORMONT] is on the ground unarmed and helpless , [RAST] grabs a knife and repeatedly pounds it into [JEOR MORMONT] ['S] throat until the [OLD] [BEAR] is [DEAD] . meanwhile , [SAM] rushes to [GILLY] ['S] hut and orders her that they have to escape now or they [NEVER] will . [SAM] runs out of [CRASTER] ['S] [KEEP] with [GILLY] and her baby , as loyal [NIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] members fall to the mutineers , who also [KILL] or rape [CRASTER] ['S] other wives .

at the [CITY] of [ASTAPOR] in [SLAVER] ['S] [BAY] , [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] arrives before [KRAZNYS] mo nakloz and the other slave [MASTERS] of the [CITY] , with her [DOTHRAKI] guards carrying the largest of her [DRAGONS] , [DROGON] , in its large cage . [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] is accompanied by her queensgard members , ser [JORAH MORMONT] and ser [BARRISTAN SELMY] . [MISSANDEI] the translator , gifted to [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] at her request , is now dressed in higher quality clothing which matches [DANY] ['S] style of dress . all eight thousand of the [UNSULLIED] warrior eunuchs are gathered in the [CITY] ['S] main [SQUARE] for the transaction . the other upper class [FIRST MEN] and women of [ASTAPOR] crowd around the [SQUARE] , gawking at the dragon while slaves in heavy [CHAINS] serve them refreshments . 
 [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] reveals [DROGON] . [KRAZNYS] tells [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] , via [MISSANDEI] ['S] interpretation in the low [VALYRIAN] language , that many of the [UNSULLIED] have not yet seen [BATTLE] , so she would do well to attack some minor [CITIES] and towns here and there on her way to [WESTEROS] . the slavers will happily purchase any slaves she captures , so it's a [WIN] win situation . he also wryly notes that any young boys she sells as slaves will be castrated and ready to serve as [NEW] [UNSULLIED] when their training is over in about ten years' time . [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] lets her dragon out of its cage , and leads it on a [LONG] chain leash attached to its foot as it hovers about twenty feet in the air . she hands the leash to [KRAZNYS] , and in return he gives her a cat o nine tails with a hilt shaped like a [HARPY] , signifying ownership of the [UNSULLIED] . [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] asks if it is done , and [KRAZNYS] impatiently says that it is , as he struggles to rein in the dragon . 
to the surprise of [MISSANDEI] , [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] calls the [UNSULLIED] to attention in [VALYRIAN] , and proceeds to test them with basic [VALYRIAN] marching commands . she smiles slightly , knowing they are now hers . too distracted to notice , [KRAZNYS] complains for [MISSANDEI] to tell the bitch that the dragon won't [COME] when he commands . [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] turns to face [KRAZNYS] and bluntly says a dragon is not a slave , again in perfectly accented [VALYRIAN] . when a dumbfounded [KRAZNYS] demands an explanation , she declares that she is [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] stormborn of [HOUSE TARGARYEN] , of the [BLOOD] of [OLD] [VALYRIA] [VALYRIAN] is her [MOTHER] tongue indicating she'd been feigning ignorance the entire time and putting up with [KRAZNYS]' insulting comments to lull them into a false sense of security . 
 [DROGON] burns [KRAZNYS] the [UNSULLIED] [SACK] [ASTAPOR] . [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] then addresses the thousands of [UNSULLIED] , and orders them to [KILL] all of the slave [MASTERS] in [ASTAPOR] , along with all of their household soldiers and any [MAN] who holds a whip . she cautions them to spare any [CHILDREN] , and to strike the [CHAINS] off any slave they see . the [UNSULLIED] obey her commands [WITHOUT] question , and instantly begin attacking all of the assembled slave [MASTERS] . [KRAZNYS] frantically shouts for someone to [KILL] [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] , to which she calmly orders dracarys . [DROGON] breathes [FIRE] onto [KRAZNYS] , completely engulfing the [SLAVER] in flames as he thrashes about in his death throes . her dragon then flies across the upper walls where the other [HIGH] ranking slave [MASTERS] are watching , burning them all to death . the [UNSULLIED] proceed to [SACK] the entire [CITY] , slaughtering the slave [MASTERS] and freeing fellow slaves , supported by the [FIRE] of [DAENERYS TARGARYEN]' [DRAGONS] . 
after the [SACK] of [ASTAPOR] is finished , [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] walks past [KRAZNYS]' charred remains , mounts a [WHITE] horse , and addresses her [UNSULLIED] . she declares that they have spent their entire lives as slaves , but now she sets them [FREE] . if any [MAN] wishes to leave , she will not stop him , and no harm will [COME] to him if he goes . she asks the [UNSULLIED] to stay and fight for her , not as slaves but as [FREE] [FIRST MEN] . for a moment the [UNSULLIED] stare blankly they have [NEVER] known what freedom is . then one starts tapping the [END] of his spear against the ground in support , and the others join in , until thousands of [UNSULLIED] are triumphantly striking their spears against the ground in praise of [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] . she has what her brother dreamed about for seventeen years but could [NEVER] find an [ARMY] with which to reconquer the [SEVEN KINGDOMS] . 
 [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] marches forward with her [ARMY] and [DRAGONS] . [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] rides triumphantly out of the smoking wreck of [ASTAPOR] , and drops the slave master's whip on the ground . the [UNSULLIED] trample the whip under their feet as they march past . she rides out with her eight thousand strong [ARMY] of [UNSULLIED] marching in formation , as her [THREE] [DRAGONS] fly above them . for the [FIRST MEN] time in generations , a [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] has begun to [CONQUER] again , begining the liberation of [SLAVER] ['S] [BAY] .

 [TORMUND] warns [JON] . [JON SNOW] is with the group of twenty [WILDLINGS] under the command of [TORMUND] , who were sent ahead of the main [ARMY] of king [BEYOND] the [WALL] [MANCE RAYDER] to scale the [WALL] and attack [CASTLE BLACK] from behind . [JON SNOW] and [YGRITTE] are gathering firewood , when the warg [ORELL] asks him about the defenses of the [NIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] . [ORELL] has seen through the eyes of his eagle that there are patrols on top of the [WALL] and he wants to know how frequent they are . [JON SNOW] says they usually sent out patrols in teams of four , [TWO] builders to inspect for structural damage and [TWO] rangers to protect them , but that the frequency of their patrols often changes . [ORELL] says the [WILDLINGS] know there are nineteen castles along the [SOUTH] side of the [WALL] , but he wants to know how many are currently manned . [JON SNOW] finds this very unpleasant , but reluctantly says that only [THREE] are currently manned . apart from [CASTLE BLACK] which even the [WILDLINGS] know is manned , there is also eastwatch by the [SEA] at the extreme eastern [END] , and the [SHADOW] [TOWER] at the western [END] . [JON SNOW] is then asked how many [FIRST MEN] currently garrison [CASTLE BLACK] . [JON SNOW] is very reluctant to answer , but after being threatened by [ORELL] , he gives an exaggerated number , saying there are one thousand [FIRST MEN] this is a lie , as [CASTLE BLACK] only had six hundred [FIRST MEN] before the [GREAT] ranging , and the garrison now is closer to [THREE] hundred . [TORMUND] tells [JON SNOW] that he likes him , but if he's lying to them , he'll rip his guts out through his throat . 
 [YGRITTE] is caught off guard when [JON SNOW] begins performing oral sex on her . 
 [JON SNOW] and [YGRITTE] then [WALK] away , but she steals his sword [LONGCLAW] , making him chase her to get it back . she leads him into a nearby cave , which is heated by natural hotsprings , which form a waterfall and a pool . [YGRITTE] starts disrobing , and says that she wants to make sure [JON SNOW] has truly [COME] over to the [WILDLINGS]' side and [BROKEN] his [NIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] vows by making him break his oath of celibacy with her . she quickly shucks off all of her clothes and walks up to him naked . [JON SNOW] is very hesitant to break his vows , and very shy because he's [NEVER] had sex before . [YGRITTE] questions why he's still dressed , and they start kissing . [JON SNOW] continues to kiss down her body as she insists that he has no experience and therefore you know nothing , [JON SNOW] sn but stops mid word as [JON SNOW] starts performing oral sex on her . 
 [JON SNOW] and [YGRITTE] taking a bath after sex . some time after they finish having sex , they lie together in a naked embrace . [YGRITTE] asks if that thing you did with your mouth is what lords do to their ladies in the [SOUTH] , but [JON SNOW] says she just seemed to like it when he [KISSED] her there . he admits he's [NEVER] had sex with anyone before and is a maid , though [YGRITTE] starts listing off some wildling boys she's had sex with before . the [FIRST MEN] was a [BOY] who also had [RED] hair like her , which is rare among the [WILDLINGS] and considered very lucky they call having [RED] hair being [KISSED] by [FIRE] , and another was a [THENN] that was built like an ox , but he could not speak the common tongue . [JON SNOW] and [YGRITTE] then slide into the [HOT] springs pool to take a bath together and romantically cuddle more . [YGRITTE] tells [JON SNOW] she wishes they could stay in this cave forever instead of having to leave and face the [WINTER] , [WARS] , and monsters [OUTSIDE] .

in [SLAVER] ['S] [BAY] , [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] ['S] [NEW] [ARMY] of freed [UNSULLIED] , having just sacked [ASTAPOR] , head [NORTH] to the next of the [THREE] [GREAT] [SLAVER] [CITIES] , yunkai . ser [JORAH MORMONT] tells ser [BARRISTAN SELMY] how he was knighted at the [END] of the [GREYJOY] [REBELLION] , in which they both fought . [JORAH MORMONT] explains that he was the [SECOND] [MAN] through the breach during the [SIEGE] of [PYKE] , right behind [THOROS] of [MYR] , who charged in headlong waving about his flaming sword . [BARRISTAN SELMY] thinks this is amusing as he wasn't there he was commanding the [SIEGE] of [OLD] wyk at the time . king [ROBERT BARATHEON] himself knighted [JORAH MORMONT] for his bravery that day , the proudest of [JORAH MORMONT] ['S] life , though he says what he was most thinking about was that he really needed to piss because he'd been sealed in metal plate armor for sixteen hours straight . 
 [BARRISTAN SELMY] admits that [ROBERT BARATHEON] was a good [MAN] and a good warrior , but laments that he turned out to be a terrible king . [BARRISTAN SELMY] laments that he wasted so much of his life defending [KINGS] who didn't deserve it seventeen years defending [ROBERT BARATHEON] , and the [MAD] king [AERYS TARGARYEN] before that . [BARRISTAN SELMY] explains that a [MAN] of [HONOR] must [KEEP] his vows no matter what , whether he's serving a drunk or a lunatic the reason why he [NEVER] turned on king [AERYS TARGARYEN] the way [JAIME LANNISTER] ultimately did . [BARRISTAN SELMY] says that just once before he dies , he wants to know what it's like to serve with pride , fighting for someone he believes in . 
their talk turns to [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] , and [JORAH MORMONT] says that [BARRISTAN SELMY] can believe in her . [BARRISTAN SELMY] says she'll have good [FIRST MEN] to advise her , though he respectfully warns that it might not be well for her to be seen with [JORAH MORMONT] at her side when they return to [WESTEROS] [JORAH MORMONT] admits that he [MAY NEVER] be rid of the moral taint of selling slaves , which is abhorred in [WESTEROS] . [JORAH MORMONT] then begins to subtly ask about the advisors on the [SMALL COUNCIL] , if any of them spoke against [ROBERT BARATHEON] when he wanted [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] , the last [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] , assassinated . it becomes apparent that [JORAH MORMONT] is trying to figure out if [BARRISTAN SELMY] knew that [JORAH MORMONT] was initially a spy for king [ROBERT BARATHEON] , reporting back to [VARYS] . [JORAH MORMONT] ['S] report that [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] was pregnant is what made [ROBERT BARATHEON] demand that [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] be assassinated at a [SMALL COUNCIL] meeting with [NED STARK] . [JORAH MORMONT] points out that the lord commander of the [KINGSGUARD] traditionally holds a seat on the [SMALL COUNCIL] . however , [BARRISTAN SELMY] explains that as a former [KINGSGUARD] member under [AERYS TARGARYEN] , and one who'd killed several of [ROBERT BARATHEON] ['S] friends , while [ROBERT BARATHEON] didn't mind keeping him in his position as a guard , he [MAY NEVER] really trusted his advice , so he left him out of [SMALL COUNCIL] meetings . [JORAH MORMONT] is relieved that [BARRISTAN SELMY] was therefore not present at any [SMALL COUNCIL] meeting so he couldn't have learned that [JORAH MORMONT] was sending it reports on [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] . [JORAH MORMONT] and [BARRISTAN SELMY] briefly bicker about the fact that [BARRISTAN SELMY] only just came to them , while [JORAH MORMONT] was defending [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] from [ROBERT BARATHEON] ['S] assassins for months , and [BARRISTAN SELMY] isn't lord commander here [JORAH MORMONT] takes his orders from [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] . 
meanwhile , [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] and her translator aide de camp [MISSANDEI] meet with the assembled officers of the [UNSULLIED] . she addresses them in low [VALYRIAN] , and says that now that they are no longer slaves but [FREE] [FIRST MEN] and they can make their own choices , and she asked them to choose one among them to be leader of all the [UNSULLIED] . they part ranks and one of the eunuchs steps forward . she asks him to remove his helmet and tell her his [NAME] , and he introduces himself as [GREY WORM] . [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] is confused , and [MISSANDEI] explains that when the slavemasters of [ASTAPOR] castrate slave boys to train them as [UNSULLIED] , they force [NEW] slave names onto them which are intentionally demeaning , usually a combination of a color and a kind of vermin , i.e . [GREY WORM] , [RED] [FLEA] , [BLACK] rat , etc . this is to enforce the mentality in the [UNSULLIED] that this is just what they are worthless , expendable vermin . disgusted , [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] issues the command that all [UNSULLIED] must choose their own [NEW] names as [FREE] [FIRST MEN] , or reclaim the names their parents gave them . the [UNSULLIED] commander says that he will continue to be known as [GREY WORM] his original [NAME] is accursed , because it was the [NAME] he had when he was taken as a slave , but [GREY WORM] is a lucky [NAME] he will [BEAR] with pride , because it is the [NAME] he had when he was set [FREE] by [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] stormborn of [HOUSE TARGARYEN] . [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] is deeply touched by his loyalty .

at [RIVERRUN] , the prisoners [MARTYN] and [WILLEM] [JAIME LANNISTER] squires fifteen and fourteen years [OLD] , respectively awake to hear shouting and fighting [OUTSIDE] the [DOOR] to their cell . lord [RICKARD KARSTARK] fights his way into the room with some of his own [FIRST MEN] . confused , [WILLEM] asks if this is a rescue , and is promptly killed by the [RICKARD KARSTARK] [FIRST MEN] . [MARTYN] begs that he is just a squire and didn't do anything , but lord [RICKARD KARSTARK] ignores his pleas and stabs him in the belly with a dagger , killing him . . 
 [MARTYN] and [WILLEM] lie [DEAD] before [ROBB] . 
the bloody corpses of the [TWO] [JAIME LANNISTER] prisoners are laid out on the floor in front of king in the [NORTH] [ROBB STARK] in [RIVERRUN] ['S] main meeting room . [ROBB STARK] is disgusted , remarking that [RICKARD KARSTARK] needed [FIVE] [FIRST MEN] to brutally murder [TWO] unarmed squires in their own prison cell . [RICKARD KARSTARK] insists that it was a father's vengeance . [ROBB STARK] points out that these boys had nothing to do with the death of [RICKARD KARSTARK] ['S] [SONS] , who were both killed by [JAIME LANNISTER] . [RICKARD KARSTARK] explains that he was denied his vengeance when [ROBB STARK] ['S] [MOTHER] [CATELYN] set [JAIME LANNISTER] [FREE] in hopes of a prisoner exchange for her daughters in king's [LANDING] . finally having enough , [RICKARD KARSTARK] did the next best thing , and killed [JAIME LANNISTER] ['S] kin who they held prisoner . [ROBB STARK] angrily shouts that they were only little boys , and [RICKARD KARSTARK] can't blame [CATELYN] for his treasonous killing of prisoners of war . [RICKARD KARSTARK] stands firm , and says the only treason is in letting their enemies go , when in war they should be killing them if [ROBB STARK] ['S] father ever taught him that . [BRYNDEN] [TULLY] punches [RICKARD KARSTARK] over this remark , but [ROBB STARK] tells him to leave [RICKARD KARSTARK] alone . [RICKARD KARSTARK] has utterly lost [FAITH] in [ROBB STARK] , and says that the king in the [NORTH] will just give him a scolding , though he should probably call him the king who lost the [NORTH] after he allowed [WINTERFELL] to fall . [ROBB STARK] orders all of [RICKARD KARSTARK] ['S] [FIRST MEN] hanged , and to hang the lookout last so he can [WATCH] the others [DIE] . [RICKARD KARSTARK] himself is sent to the dungeons . 
 [ROBB STARK] ['S] uncle [EDMURE] [TULLY] insists that if word of this leaves [RIVERRUN] , [TYWIN LANNISTER] will exact heavy reprisals for the deaths of his young nephews . therefore , he suggests that they just quietly bury the boys , and simply [KEEP] [SILENT] about their deaths until the war is over . [ROBB STARK] , however , refuses to be a liar he says he can not fight a war in the [NAME] of justice if he will not serve justice to murderers within his own ranks . all of [ROBB STARK] ['S] advisors tell him this is a bad idea . [CATELYN] and his wife [TALISA] warn him that the [RICKARD KARSTARK] soldiers will abandon his cause and return [HOME] if he executes their lord , and they are already badly outnumbered . [CATELYN] says they should [KEEP] lord [RICKARD KARSTARK] hostage , and [EDMURE] agrees , saying that they can just [KEEP] him hostage and tell the other [KARSTARKS] that no harm will [COME] to him so [LONG] as they remain loyal . . 
 [ROBB STARK] executes [RICKARD KARSTARK] . 
 [ROBB STARK] ignores their pleas , and he has lord [RICKARD KARSTARK] brought out to the courtyard of [RIVERRUN] to be executed during a driving rainstorm . [RICKARD KARSTARK] points out that not only are both of their [HOUSES] descended from the [FIRST MEN] , but the [KARSTARKS] and [KARSTARKS] are kin as [HOUSE KARSTARK] is a cadet branch of [HOUSE STARK] , founded centuries ago by younger son karlon [HOUSE STARK] . [ROBB STARK] says that their [BLOOD] relationship did not stop [RICKARD KARSTARK] from betraying him and won't stop [ROBB STARK] from executing him now , but [RICKARD KARSTARK] says it isn't meant to he wants it to haunt [ROBB STARK] until the day he dies . with his last [WORDS] , lord [RICKARD KARSTARK] says that [ROBB STARK] will be cursed as a kinslayer and that [ROBB STARK] is no king of his . obedient to the [LAWS] of his father [EDDARD STARK] that the [MAN] who passes the sentence must swing the sword [ROBB STARK] pronounces the sentence of death and personally beheads lord [RICKARD KARSTARK] . 
 [ROBB STARK] ['S] strict adherence to justice makes [THINGS] turn out just as badly as his advisors said they would the [KARSTARKS] withdraw their soldiers from his [ARMY] and march for [HOME] , resulting in [ROBB STARK] losing almost half of his forces which were stationed at [RIVERRUN] . [ROBB STARK] openly admits to [TALISA] that she was right , and he made a mistake . [ROBB STARK] says [TYWIN LANNISTER] realizes that he's in such a strong position he doesn't even need to attack the [NORTHERNERS] anymore , he just needs to wait , and let their demoralized forces unravel . when the war began [ROBB STARK] ['S] [ARMY] was unified around a central purpose , but now they have lost momentum , and his generals are acting like bickering [CHILDREN] . [ROBB STARK] shows [TALISA] a war map of the [SEVEN KINGDOMS] depicting [ROBB STARK] ['S] armies concentrated around [RIVERRUN] and [HARRENHAL] , [TYWIN LANNISTER] and [TYRELL] armies overrunning the [STORMLANDS] , [LANNISTER TYRELL] armies concentrated in king's [LANDING] , and [GREYJOY] forces occupying the western coasts of the [NORTH] . [TALISA] suggests that he try to take the fight to the [LANNISTERS] if they won't [COME] to him , but he explains that this is hopeless . taking king's [LANDING] would have been difficult to begin with , but now [TYWIN LANNISTER] and the bulk of the main [TYWIN LANNISTER] [ARMY] , as well as a large [LANNISTER TYRELL] [ARMY] , are defending the [CITY] . attacking the capital head on would be suicide , and [TYWIN LANNISTER] would crush them within a day . [TALISA] suggests that he lead his [ARMY] back to the [NORTH] to repulse the greyjoys from his homeland and rebuild his powerbase . [ROBB STARK] points out that as soon as all of his tired soldiers are back [HOME] , they won't want to leave again particularly because [WINTER] is [COMING] , and the [COMING] one is expected to be very [LONG] , [FIVE] years or more . the [NORTHERNERS] have been away from their farms fighting in the war , however , so they haven't even begun to collect harvests to set aside as [WINTER] stockpiles . thus if [ROBB STARK] returns to the [NORTH] , it will be difficult to rally his [FIRST MEN] to return [SOUTH] to defend the riverlords who declared for him . eyeing the map with [TALISA] , [ROBB STARK] decides that if king's [LANDING] is too strong to attack and he can't return [HOME] , his only remaining option is to strike where his enemy is weakest . [ROBB STARK] decides that with the main [TYWIN LANNISTER] [ARMY] group under [TYWIN LANNISTER] now positioned all the way to the east in king's [LANDING] , he needs to return to the [WESTERLANDS] and make an all or nothing assault against [CASTERLY ROCK] . this will make the [LANNISTERS] lose face , just as [ROBB STARK] did when he lost his [HOME] [CASTLE] of [WINTERFELL] , and bring momentum back to his [ARMY] . however , with the loss of the [RICKARD KARSTARK] forces , they don't currently have enough [FIRST MEN] to consider attacking [CASTERLY ROCK] . the only way they can gain enough soldiers to even attempt such an assault is if [ROBB STARK] can [TYWIN LANNISTER] back the allegiance of [HOUSE FREY] , whose thousands of soldiers withdrew from [ROBB STARK] ['S] [ARMY] when he broke his promise to make a marriage alliance with them by marrying [TALISA] , a political nobody , instead of one of the lord [WALDER FREY] ['S] daughters . thus , [ROBB STARK] must try to repair his alliance with [HOUSE FREY] . 
 [LOCKE] taunting [JAIME] about his [HAND] . at [HARRENHAL] , [LOCKE] presents the captive [JAIME LANNISTER] and [BRIENNE] of [TARTH] to the [NORTHERN] castellan , lord [ROOSE BOLTON] . [LOCKE] is quite proud of himself for his torture of [JAIME LANNISTER] , but [ROOSE BOLTON] is surprised that [JAIME LANNISTER] has lost his [HAND] . oblivious , [LOCKE] boasts that [JAIME LANNISTER] hasn't lost the [HAND] , and points out that he cut it off and hung [JAIME LANNISTER] ['S] own [HAND] around his [NECK] . angered that [LOCKE] maimed such a valuable hostage , [ROOSE BOLTON] demands that he dispose of [JAIME LANNISTER] ['S] rotting [HAND] , and orders that accommodations be provided for the pair of prisoners . when [JAIME LANNISTER] asks if there is news from the capital , [ROOSE BOLTON] informs him that [STANNIS BARATHEON] laid [SIEGE] to the [CITY] in the [BATTLE] of the [BLACKWATER] ... then needlessly drags out revealing the result . [ROOSE BOLTON] toys with [JAIME LANNISTER] but remains completely calm , [NEVER] even grinning , before finally revealing that his sister [CERSEI] is alive and well , and his father's forces successfully repulsed [STANNIS BARATHEON] ['S] assault . [JAIME LANNISTER] is so overcome by delirium and relief that his family is safe that he collapses . [ROOSE BOLTON] calls for [QYBURN] to attend to [JAIME LANNISTER] ['S] injuries . later , [QYBURN] peels away the crude tourniquet that [LOCKE] ['S] [FIRST MEN] applied to [JAIME LANNISTER] , and finds that the stump of his right arm has become badly infected . [JAIME LANNISTER] asks if he will [DIE] , and [QYBURN] says he won't , but the corruption has spread to the point that it would be safest just to amputate the rest of his right arm at the shoulder . half delirious from the infection , [JAIME LANNISTER] refuses , and says he'll [KILL] [QYBURN] if he tries . [JAIME LANNISTER] then notices that [QYBURN] is not a maester , because he isn't wearing a maester's chain of office . [QYBURN] acknowledges this , explaining that he was stripped of his chain by the [CITADEL] and thrown out of the order of maesters , because as he says , he was conducting experiments which they felt were too bold . [QYBURN] gets ready to cut [JAIME LANNISTER] , and says he'll at least try to save his elbow , but with a sudden burst of effort [JAIME LANNISTER] grabs him around the throat with his left [HAND] , and says he doesn't need his right [HAND] to [KILL] him . [QYBURN] relents , and says he could try cutting out the chunks of flesh which are outright rotten , then burning out the wounds with boiling wine , and with luck this might be able to stop the infection [WITHOUT] having to amputate more of [JAIME LANNISTER] ['S] arm above the wrist . [JAIME LANNISTER] says he's willing to try this , but [QYBURN] cautions that it will cause a [GREAT] amount of pain so he needs to give him milk of the poppy , but [JAIME LANNISTER] refuses to take it , and says he'll just scream . [QYBURN] cautions him that it will cause a massive amount of pain , but [JAIME LANNISTER] says that he will just scream loudly . [QYBURN] begins to dig into the stump of [JAIME LANNISTER] ['S] arm to cut out the gangrenous tissue , and [JAIME LANNISTER] howls in agony . 
some time later , [BRIENNE] is in [HARRENHAL] ['S] bathhouse , scrubbing off weeks' worth of caked on grime and filth from the trek through the [RIVERLANDS] . [JAIME LANNISTER] then appears in the doorway assisted by a servant , barely able to stand due to the pain he is in . he asks the servant to help him take off his muddy rags and leave . [JAIME LANNISTER] then walks naked into the same communal bath that [BRIENNE] is in , on the far side . she is also naked and angrily points out that there are other baths , but he says he wants this one he's afraid he's going to pass out at any moment , and wants her to save him from drowning if he does , because he doesn't want to be the [FIRST MEN] [JAIME LANNISTER] to [DIE] in a bathtub . [BRIENNE] asks why she should care how he dies , but he points out that she swore a solemn vow to get him to king's [LANDING] in one piece which indicating the stump of his [HAND] has not been going so well . [JAIME LANNISTER] quips that it's no wonder [RENLY] died with [BRIENNE] guarding him , at which she defiantly stands up out of the bath , facing him fully nude , to show him she isn't afraid of him . [JAIME LANNISTER] gravely says that was unworthy and asks for forgiveness , [BRIENNE] angrily orders him not to mock her , but he insists he's seriously apologizing . exhausted , [JAIME LANNISTER] says he's tired of fighting and just wants to have a truce [BRIENNE] says you need trust to have a truce , but he says he trusts her , so she sits back down . 
 [JAIME LANNISTER] recounts [AERYS] ['S] madness . [JAIME LANNISTER] then notes that [BRIENNE] has the same look on her face that he's seen on countless [FACES] in the past seventeen years people that despise him , call him kingslayer more than his own [NAME] , or [OATHBREAKER] and a [MAN WITHOUT HONOR] . [JAIME LANNISTER] then goes on to recall the [MAD] king's obsession with [WILDFIRE] , how [AERYS] enjoyed watching people being burned alive . [JAIME LANNISTER] recalls [AERYS] burned lords he didn't like , hands who failed him , and anyone he thought was against him . ultimately , half of [WESTEROS] rebelled against him , so [AERYS] had his pyromancers place caches of [WILDFIRE] all over king's [LANDING] under the [GREAT SEPT] of [BAELOR] , under the slums of [FLEA BOTTOM] , under [HOUSES] , stables , taverns , and even under the [RED KEEP] itself . after [ROBERT] ['S] victory at the [TRIDENT] he marched on the capital [CITY] , but [JAIME LANNISTER] ['S] father [TYWIN] arrived there [FIRST MEN] , leading the entire [JAIME LANNISTER] [ARMY] , and promising to defend the [CITY] . [JAIME LANNISTER] warned [AERYS] that his father was [NEVER] a [MAN WITHOUT HONOR] to choose the losing side , that this must be a trick and he should surrender the [CITY] while he still could , but the [MAD] king refused to listen . nor did [AERYS] listen to [VARYS] when he gave the same warning that [TYWIN] couldn't be trusted but he did listen to [GRAND] maester [PYCELLE] , who convinced [AERYS] the [LANNISTERS] were there to help . [AERYS] opened the [CITY] gates , and the [LANNISTERS] proceeded to [SACK] the [CITY] . [JAIME LANNISTER] again begged [AERYS] to surrender , but the [MAD] king ordered [JAIME LANNISTER] to bring him [TYWIN] ['S] head , and his pyromancer to set the [CITY] ablaze , burning its hundreds of thousands of inhabitants with [WILDFIRE] . [JAIME LANNISTER] makes it plain to [BRIENNE] that was his breaking point and asks her what she would do if her precious [RENLY] commanded her to [KILL] her own father and then stand by and do nothing as he murdered thousands of innocent people she can only sit in shocked silence . [JAIME LANNISTER] goes on to say that he killed the pyromancer [FIRST MEN] , then drove his sword into [AERYS] ['S] back as the [MAD] king tried to run for his life . shaken at the memory , [JAIME LANNISTER] speculates that king [AERYS] didn't believe he would [DIE] in the blaze in his lunacy , the [MAD] king believed he would be reborn as a dragon in the [WILDFIRE] , granting him the power to burn his enemies to ashes ... so [JAIME LANNISTER] finished [AERYS] off by slitting his throat in order to make sure he died , concluding that [EDDARD STARK] found him at that point . 
stunned , [BRIENNE] asks why [JAIME LANNISTER] didn't defend himself with this account before . [JAIME LANNISTER] angrily rants that the honorable lord [EDDARD STARK] would [NEVER] have believed a word he said [EDDARD STARK] didn't want to hear [JAIME LANNISTER] ['S] side of the story when he'd already judged him guilty . [JAIME LANNISTER] faints . [JAIME LANNISTER] goes on to rage , yelling what right [EDDARD STARK] had to judge him , by what right the [WOLF] dares to judge the [LION] . the strain of recounting his harrowing tale overcomes [JAIME LANNISTER] , however , and he begins to faint , nearly falling face [FIRST MEN] into the [WATER] . [BRIENNE] catches him and calls for help for the kingslayer , at which as he slips out of consciousness he whimpers to himself [JAIME LANNISTER] . my [NAME] is [JAIME LANNISTER] . 
the [HOUND] vs [BERIC] . 
elsewhere in the [RIVERLANDS] , at the hideout of the [BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS] in hollow hill , [SANDOR CLEGANE] prepares to fight [BERIC] [DONDARRION] in a trial by combat . as both [FIRST MEN] prepare , [THOROS] of [MYR] prays to the lord of [LIGHT] to judge [SANDOR CLEGANE] for his crimes if he is guilty or give strength to his sword if he is innocent . before the fight begins , [BERIC] calls upon the lord of [LIGHT] to ignite his sword with flame , using only his [BLOOD] . due to the [SANDOR CLEGANE] ['S] fear of [WILDFIRE] , [BERIC] initially has an advantage against the [HOUND] . [BERIC] even manages to set [SANDOR CLEGANE] ['S] wooden shield on [WILDFIRE] , which is strapped so tightly to [SANDOR CLEGANE] ['S] arm that he can not remove it and is nearly burned himself . eventually , however , [SANDOR CLEGANE] ['S] raw physical strength and anger born of terror overpowers [BERIC] , and with a single downward swipe , cuts right through his flaming sword , his armor , and deep into his shoulder , killing him . 
 [THOROS] reviving [BERIC] . 
as [BERIC] falls to the ground , [THOROS] quickly rushes to his side , and begins praying to the lord of [LIGHT] to revive him . [SANDOR CLEGANE] falls to the ground to desperately try and extinguish his flaming shield . [ARYA STARK] grabs a dagger and attempts to [KILL] the [HOUND] while he is down , but she is stopped by [GENDRY] . as she curses him , [SANDOR CLEGANE] taunts [ARYA STARK] over how the [GOD] prefers him over her [DEAD] friend , however they are both interrupted by [BERIC] , who has been revived by the lord of [LIGHT] ['S] power . having won the trial , and proven his innocence in the eyes of [GOD] , [SANDOR CLEGANE] is allowed to leave . the [BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS] had taken all of the gold [SANDOR CLEGANE] had on him to fund their cause , and in lieu of returning it , [BERIC] gives him a promissory note which will grant payment at the [END] of the war . [SANDOR CLEGANE] scoffs at this and throws it to the ground , but [ANGUY] says he should be thankful they're letting him leave with his life . [SANDOR CLEGANE] is hooded so he won't know the way back to their hideout , then led away to be released some distance away . 
after the fight , [GENDRY] works on repairing [BERIC] ['S] armor , and [ARYA STARK] questions why , because they will be leaving soon . [GENDRY] says that he has decided to stay and work as a smith for the [BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS] , to aid them in their cause to protect the smallfolk during the war . [ARYA STARK] says that their plan was to find her brother [ROBB] , and [ROBB] needs soldiers too , but [GENDRY] points out that he has no attachments to [ROBB STARK] [ARYA STARK] would be going to her noble born family , and he'd just be serving another lord . [GENDRY] says he's been serving other [FIRST MEN] his whole life and he has nothing to show for it he worked most of his life for tobho mott and he repaid [GENDRY] by selling him to the [NIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] as soon as the secret payments from [VARYS] [ENDED] , and he served [TYWIN LANNISTER] as a prisoner at [HARRENHAL] , every day afraid he'd be killed or tortured . he'd be serving in the [BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS] too , but they chose [BERIC] as their leader , and they're more like a family and as a common born tavern [MAIDEN] ['S] son who was orphaned at a young age , [GENDRY] has [NEVER] had a family . [ARYA STARK] sadly chokes out that she could be his family . in response , [GENDRY] politely but firmly points out that the class differences between them mean that if he goes back with her , they'd [NEVER] be family he'd still be a commoner , and she'd be m'lady . 
later that [NIGHT] , [ARYA STARK] looks into the campfire and recites her nightly prayer list for the death of her enemies . [THOROS] says that they plan to bring her to [RIVERRUN] to reunite her with her family , and in exchange for a reward from [ROBB STARK] to fund their cause . [ARYA STARK] points out that they are ransoming her , and [THOROS] admits they technically are , but this is different . they do intend to escort her safely through the war ravaged countryside to her family , and [BERIC] would like to return her for [FREE] out of memory of her father , but they really need the gold to support themselves . [BERIC] says he knows she must be angry with him , but releasing [SANDOR CLEGANE] was the right thing to do , as they'd promised to let him go [FREE] if he won the trial by combat . [ARYA STARK] is still quietly upset , as she's now seen many honorable [FIRST MEN] [KEEP] their promises and behave lawfully only to be killed for it such as [YOREN] and her own father . she wonders why [BERIC] would want to let [SANDOR CLEGANE] go when he nearly killed him , but [BERIC] insists that he did actually [KILL] him . when [ARYA STARK] asks how , [BERIC] points her to [THOROS] to explain , but he says that he isn't the one who brings [BERIC] back to life , it's the lord of [LIGHT] , and [THOROS] is just the lucky drunk who recites the prayers . [BERIC] opens his shirt to reveal several grievous scars on his torso they explain that [BERIC] has actually died and then been brought back to life six times now , counting his recent death in the trial by combat . he has been impaled on a lance , shot with an arrow , and at his fifth death the [LANNISTERS] hanged him for treason and stuck a dagger in his eye which didn't heal when [THOROS] brought him back . [ARYA STARK] earnestly asks [THOROS] if he could bring back to life a [MAN WITHOUT] a head . [THOROS] and [BERIC] both understand that she is asking about bringing back her father , but [THOROS] says he doesn't think it works that way both because he was decapitated , and because he's been [DEAD] for far too [LONG] by now . [BERIC] consoles her that her father was a good [MAN WITHOUT] , but he wouldn't wish his resurrected life on him . [BERIC] explains that being brought back from the [DEAD] carries a heavy toll , as pieces of his memory and who he was before chip away each time . [ARYA STARK] still says she would wish [BERIC] ['S] life on her father , because at least [BERIC] is still alive . 
at [DRAGONSTONE] , king [STANNIS BARATHEON] is still deeply depressed after his defeat at the [BATTLE] of the [BLACKWATER] , and doesn't have the daily support of the [RED PRIESTESS] [MELISANDRE] since she left on what she claimed was an important mission . most of [STANNIS BARATHEON]' [ARMY] has been destroyed , and the only reason the [LANNISTERS] haven't attacked [DRAGONSTONE] yet is because so much of their fleet was destroyed at [BLACKWATER] that they can not yet mount an amphibious assault . with little else to do , [STANNIS BARATHEON] takes the time to visit his wife , queen [SELYSE] who was born into [HOUSE FLORENT] , for the [FIRST MEN] time since returning from the [BATTLE] . he finds her in her chamber , praying over a [FIRE] to the lord of [LIGHT] [SELYSE] is a fanatical believer in the lord of [LIGHT] religion , far more so than [STANNIS BARATHEON] , and it was indeed [SELYSE] who [FIRST MEN] invited [MELISANDRE] to [DRAGONSTONE] . [STANNIS BARATHEON] and [SELYSE] do not have a loving relationship , but she reveres and is in awe of him as her king and the lord's chosen . she tells him not to despair despite his defeat , and he will be victorious , but he laments that he used to believe that once . due to his extreme belief in duty , unlike his hedonistic brother [ROBERT] [STANNIS BARATHEON] is badly shaken by the fact that he broke his marriage vows to [SELYSE] , when he had sex with [MELISANDRE] to create the [SHADOW] assassin creature that killed [RENLY] . he begins to confess to [SELYSE] that he has sinned and shamed her , but she interrupts him and says [MELISANDRE] already told her everything and that no act done in service of the lord of [LIGHT] can be a sin . indeed , she wept for joy when [MELISANDRE] told her of this service she did for the lord of [LIGHT] with [STANNIS BARATHEON] , and because the [RED PRIESTESS] gave him a son of sorts which she [NEVER] could . [STANNIS BARATHEON]' face is filled with a mix of shock , disgust , and relief . [SELYSE] had [THREE] [SONS] with [STANNIS BARATHEON] but they were all stillborn , and she walks over to a corner of her chamber where she keeps their tiny corpses preserved in glass jars . the deaths of her sweet boys and failure to produce a male heir deeply affected [SELYSE] , and caused her to zealously embrace the foreign religion of the lord of [LIGHT] . she weeps , and laments that she has given [STANNIS BARATHEON] nothing he does not blame her , and with pity he says that's not true . [SELYSE] understands he is referring to their daughter and only child , princess [SHIREEN] [STANNIS BARATHEON] . she grows annoyed when she realizes he's [COME] to see her too , and says he shouldn't [WASTE] time on such distractions , but insists that she is his daughter , and she relents because it is not her place to question her king . [SHIREEN] visits [DAVOS] while in the dungeons . 
 [SHIREEN] is alone in her room drawing and singing a song about life under the [SEA] to herself , and is excited to see her father . she is a cheerful but sickly young girl about the same age as [ARYA STARK] , with the left side of her face badly scarred and disfigured by the dreaded greyscale disease . [STANNIS BARATHEON] wanted to see his daughter , but he is awkward in expressing warm emotions to her . she says she heard he was in a [BATTLE] and asks if he won , and he good naturedly says no . [SHIREEN] is slightly let down , but asks if the [ONION KNIGHT] came back as well ser [DAVOS] seaworth has been her friend during his service to her father , and he even made her a toy ship . growing tense over their falling out , [STANNIS BARATHEON] briefly explains that ser [DAVOS] is a traitor and is rotting in the dungeon . confused , he flatly says she should best put him out of her mind . 
later that [ONION KNIGHT] , [SHIREEN] sneaks down to the dungeon of [DRAGONSTONE] and finds the cell of ser [ONION KNIGHT] . he wakes up and tells her she shouldn't be there , but she explains that the fat guard [ROBERT] is on duty , who usually drinks a lot of wine and sleeps through his [WATCH] . she asks if it is true that he is a traitor , and he says that it is , as he disobeyed her father . she says she doesn't care , he's her friend . she was worried that he must get bored down in his cell , so she brought him a [BOOK] to read , about [AEGON] the [CONQUER] and his [DRAGONS] she excitedly points out that the [TARGARYENS] built [DRAGONSTONE] , and [AEGON] used to live in this very [CASTLE] . [DAVOS] reluctantly explains that it's wasted on him , because he doesn't know how to read . undaunted , [SHIREEN] offers to teach him how to read , by [COMING] down to his cell and reading to him when [ROBERT] is on duty . [DAVOS] chides her that they can't , but she asks what's the worst the guards could do to them if they find out , lock them in cells they have a quiet laugh , and [SHIREEN] starts to read to [DAVOS] an history of [AEGON] the conqueror and his conquest of [WESTEROS] . 
in king's [LANDING] , queen regent [CERSEI LANNISTER] encounters [PETYR] [LITTLEFINGER] [BAELISH] in a courtyard , and tells him she fears that the [TYRELLS] do not have the [LANNISTERS]' best interests at heart , but her father won't listen . therefore , she asks that [LITTLEFINGER] use his spies to try to find out what they're up to , because he has a good working relationship with them after brokering the [LANNISTER TYRELL] alliance . he agrees , but [CERSEI LANNISTER] warns him that this had better produce more results than when she previously asked him to find [ARYA STARK] , but the girl could not be found . 
in the [CASTLE] [GARDENS] , [SANSA STARK] and [MARGAERY TYRELL] [WATCH] her brother ser [LORAS] spar with his squire . [SANSA STARK] confidently remarks on his fighting ability , and inquires when she and [LORAS] will wed , as per the [MARGAERY TYRELL] plot to [KEEP] her out of the hands of [BAELISH] and or the [LANNISTERS] . [MARGAERY TYRELL] replies that she will plant the seed of the idea after she and [JOFFREY] are married . [SANSA STARK] is skeptical [JOFFREY] will let her go but [MARGAERY TYRELL] is confident he will do it to please her , once she is his wife . after the match , ser [LORAS]' [NEW] squire [OLYVAR] flirts with him , which leads to them having sex back in [LORAS]' chambers . as they finish , [LORAS] mentions that he is engaged to be married ... a fact that [OLYVAR] passes on to his real master , [LITTLEFINGER] , so he can pass the information on to [CERSEI LANNISTER] . [LORAS] and [OLYVAR] . 
a short time later , [LITTLEFINGER] meets with [SANSA STARK] , offering her a place on his ship that will take him from the capital to the [VALE] of [ARRYN] . [SANSA STARK] practices lying for a change , and tells him that they should wait until after [JOFFREY] ['S] [WEDDING] , primarily because she fears for his safety if the plan fails . a master manipulator , [LITTLEFINGER] is clearly suspicious of her motives , but doesn't press the matter for the moment . instead he says he is touched by her concern for his safety , and insists that she call him [PETYR] . 
at the same time , [TYRION LANNISTER] is engaged in a meeting with lady [OLENNA TYRELL] with the upcoming royal [WEDDING] shaping up to be an extravagant and expensive affair , [TYRION LANNISTER] is concerned about the cost . [OLENNA TYRELL] points out that the [TYRELLS] have done much to supply the [CITY] with soldiers and provisions to assist in the war effort , as well as the [COMING] [WINTER] . [OLENNA TYRELL] is bored to discuss financial matters , but quickly lists off specific details of the soldiers and supplies the [TYRELLS] are supplying to aid the [CROWN] , demonstrating that [TYRION LANNISTER] doesn't need to lecture her about wartime expenses . she insists that the royal [WEDDING] must go on as planned , as it will do much to improve the [CITY] ['S] morale and [KEEP] the people happy , otherwise they will start blaming the [LANNISTERS] for the war again . [TYRION LANNISTER] can not outmaneuver [OLENNA TYRELL] , but in the [END] she decides on her own that she won't have it said [HOUSE TYRELL] isn't doing its part to help , so she agrees to pay for half the cost of the festivities , for which [TYRION LANNISTER] is grateful . 
 [TYRION LANNISTER] heads to the [SMALL COUNCIL] chamber to report success to his father [TYWIN] , only to find [CERSEI LANNISTER] present as well , much to his annoyance . [TYWIN] explains that the [TYRELLS] are plotting to wed [SANSA STARK] to ser [LORAS] and states that he will not allow them to steal the key to the [NORTH] out from under him . [TYRION LANNISTER] questions how [SANSA STARK] is the key to the [NORTH] , given that her older brother is still alive . [TYWIN] explains that the desertion of the [KARSTARKS] have cost [ROBB STARK] half his [ARMY] , and combined with already being badly outnumbered by the [LANNISTER TYRELL] alliance his days are now numbered . [THEON GREYJOY] murdered [ROBB STARK] ['S] younger [BROTHERS] at [WINTERFELL] , which makes [SANSA STARK] [ROBB STARK] ['S] heir if he dies , rule of [WINTERFELL] and the [NORTH] goes to her and any [MAN] she marries ... which [TYWIN] has no intention of letting the [TYRELLS] get their hands on . [TYRION LANNISTER] questions if it is [WISE] to offend their allies by refusing the match , but [TYWIN] points out that as a plot against them , the [TYRELLS]' plan is , by definition , a secret , thus the [LANNISTERS] can't be said to be refusing them something which they aren't officially trying to do . he also notes that the [TYRELLS] won't go through with their plan until after [JOFFREY] ['S] [WEDDING] , which means they need to act [FIRST] ... namely by finding [SANSA STARK] another husband . 
after a moment , [TYRION LANNISTER] realizes from the comments of his father and sister that they are talking about him . [TYRION LANNISTER] tries to protest , pointing out that [JOFFREY] has made [SANSA STARK] ['S] life a living hell since the day he had her father executed and to force [TYRION LANNISTER] on her after she has finally escaped [JOFFREY] is cruel , even by [TYWIN] ['S] standards . [TYWIN] questions if [TYRION LANNISTER] plans to mistreat [SANSA STARK] and asserts that he is not concerned with the girl's happiness and neither should his son . [TYRION LANNISTER] protests that [SANSA STARK] is a child , but [CERSEI LANNISTER] counters she has flowered and is a [WOMAN] now who can [BEAR] [CHILDREN] . [TYRION LANNISTER] flatly refuses , but [TYWIN] points out that recently he was complaining that he wasn't rewarded for his actions in the [BATTLE] of the [BLACKWATER] , and as heiress to the [NORTH] , [SANSA STARK] is a far better reward than he could expect , and in any case , it is [LONG] past time [TYRION LANNISTER] was wed. at this , [TYRION LANNISTER] snarls that he was wed , referring to his past marriage to tysha , asking if his father has forgotten that . returning his son's hateful glare with one of his own , [TYWIN] retorts that he [REMEMBERS] all too well . [TYWIN] arranges some marriages . 
 [CERSEI LANNISTER] gloats over the matter , but her smug attitude quickly evaporates when her father commands that she will wed ser [LORAS] instead . [CERSEI LANNISTER] flatly refuses , but [TYWIN] is insistent the marriages of [CERSEI LANNISTER] and [TYRION LANNISTER] will place the [NORTH] and the reach firmly in the [LANNISTERS]' control . [TYWIN] points out that [CERSEI LANNISTER] is still fertile she needs to marry and breed . when [CERSEI LANNISTER] protests she is queen regent and not a brood mare , [TYWIN] angrily roars back that she is his daughter and will do as she is told she will marry [LORAS] and in so doing , put an [END] to what [TYWIN] calls the disgusting rumors [STANNIS] has been spreading about her and [JAIME] . [CERSEI LANNISTER] switches to earnestly begging him , calling him father and pleading that he not force her into an arranged marriage a [SECOND] time after her [LONG] and loveless marriage with king [ROBERT] . [TYWIN] refuses to listen and storms out in disgust , raging that the pair have disgraced the [CERSEI LANNISTER] [NAME] for far too [LONG] . [CERSEI LANNISTER] slowly shifts her gaze toward [TYRION LANNISTER] to gauge his reaction to her distress but sees he is too glum about his own predicament .

in king's [LANDING] , lord [TYWIN LANNISTER] meets with lady [OLENNA TYRELL] to discuss having ser [LORAS] marry his daughter , [CERSEI LANNISTER] . they trade barbs about [CERSEI LANNISTER] ['S] age , [CERSEI LANNISTER] ['S] capability to have more [CHILDREN] , and accusations of incest with [JAIME] , as well as [LORAS] ['S] well known homosexuality . [TYWIN LANNISTER] is adamant that [CERSEI LANNISTER] , whom he calls the kingdom's most beautiful [WOMAN] , should marry [LORAS] , the kingdom's most handsome and desired bachelor , but [OLENNA TYRELL] blatantly refuses to consent , hinting that [JOFFREY] is the result of incest . [TYWIN LANNISTER] replies that if that is true , he has no right to the [THRONE] and the [TYRELLS] just threw a flower into the dirt . [OLENNA TYRELL] says she will not risk throwing another flower into the dirt if [CERSEI LANNISTER] can not [BEAR] heirs for the [TYRELLS] . realizing her unchanged position on the matter , [TYWIN LANNISTER] threatens to make [LORAS] a [KNIGHT] of the [KINGSGUARD] , which would force [LORAS] to give up his right to marriage and to inherit [HIGHGARDEN] . [OLENNA TYRELL] relents , and consents to the marriage of [LORAS] and [CERSEI LANNISTER] . 
in the [GARDENS] , [SANSA STARK] tries to get closer to [LORAS] by discussing their hopefully impending [WEDDING] . [LORAS] is clearly uncomfortable being so close to her , but brightens when discussing the lavish [WEDDING] he's had planned although [SANSA STARK] , for once , becomes suspicious when she realizes that [LORAS] seems more excited by the food and the [WEDDING] joust than by her . [LORAS] quickly placates her with a compliment and then describes the [WEDDING] gown he's envisioned for her . [SANSA STARK] says she's looking forward to seeing [HIGHGARDEN] , as she's only ever lived in [WINTERFELL] and can't wait to leave king's [LANDING] . in this , [LORAS] finds unexpected common ground with her and agrees that the [RED KEEP] is the most terrible place there is . 
 [CERSEI LANNISTER] and [TYRION LANNISTER] observe the couple from [CERSEI LANNISTER] ['S] chambers overlooking the [HIGHGARDEN] . [TYRION LANNISTER] sarcastically asks which of the four of them has it the worst . he then finally accuses his sister of trying to have him killed during the [BATTLE] of the [BLACKWATER] . [CERSEI LANNISTER] , tired of fighting him , remains quiet while he deduces that only [TWO] people can command the [KINGSGUARD] . [TYRION LANNISTER] realizes that while [CERSEI LANNISTER] certainly has the authority to command a [KINGSGUARD] , she isn't stupid enough to command ser [MANDON MOORE] to [KILL] him in public . [TYRION LANNISTER] realizes that it was in fact [JOFFREY] who ordered ser [MANDON MOORE] to [KILL] him , because [TYRION LANNISTER] was the only one who stood up to him . [CERSEI LANNISTER] tells him his life is not in danger from [JOFFREY] , as he dare not try anything like that now that [TYWIN LANNISTER] is the [HAND] . they discuss about [JAIME] ['S] possible return to king's [LANDING] , with [CERSEI LANNISTER] wondering where he could possibly be . she asks [TYRION LANNISTER] which one of them should be the one to break the news to [SANSA STARK] . 
 [TYRION LANNISTER] decides he might as well dash [SANSA STARK] ['S] hopes sooner rather than later . he goes to [SANSA STARK] ['S] chamber and asks for a private word , but [SANSA STARK] declines to dismiss [SHAE] . [TYRION LANNISTER] gives [SHAE] a carefully coded apology for not telling her in private before breaking the news to [SANSA STARK] . 
later on , lord [VARYS] finds lord [PETYR] [BAELISH] in the [THRONE] room . [VARYS] and [BAELISH] discuss the [IRON THRONE] and the pageantry and propaganda that creates nations and cements dynasties . [VARYS] asserts that he serves the [REALM] , but [BAELISH] scoffs that the [REALM] is an invention of [AEGON] the conqueror . [BAELISH] tells [VARYS] that he is aware of [VARYS]' arrangement with ros , and that he has given her to a friend who is eager for a [NEW] experience . [BAELISH] revels in the chaos that he has caused , likening chaos to a ladder for those brave enough to [CLIMB] rather than a [PIT] to be lost in , as [VARYS] and everyone else sees it . 
 [JOFFREY] kills ros . 
elsewhere , [SANSA STARK] weeps as [BAELISH] ['S] ship departs , both of her plans to leave king's [LANDING] in tatters . meanwhile , [JOFFREY] coldly contemplates ros's quarrel ridden corpse .

[MELISANDRE] is brought to the [BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS] ['S] hideout and is shocked when she learns of the six deaths of [BERIC] [DONDARRION] , exclaiming that [THOROS] should not have that kind of power . [THOROS] counters that he has no power , he only asks for favors and the lord of [LIGHT] sees fit to grant them . the [PRIESTESS] seems troubled by his response or perhaps by the fact that the lord of [LIGHT] looks favorably on causes other than her own . [MELISANDRE] says the [BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS] has someone the lord of [LIGHT] needs , and soon after has her [MEN] take [GENDRY] into her custody . [ARYA STARK] protests , particularly when she sees that [MELISANDRE] has given the [BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS] [TWO] heavy sacks of gold in exchange . she confronts the [RED PRIESTESS] , calling her a witch . [MELISANDRE] ignores the barb and looks into [ARYA STARK] ['S] eyes . she sees many other eyes , of many other colors eyes that [ARYA STARK] will shut forever . [MELISANDRE] abruptly tells her that they will meet again .

[JAIME] assumes that [BRIENNE] will accompany him , but [ROOSE BOLTON] intends to [KEEP] her with him , under arrest for abetting treason .

[DANY] however is adamant on freeing the slaves of yunkai , who number in the hundreds of thousands . she orders [GREY WORM] to send a messenger to the [CITY] and inform yunkai's [SLAVER] rulers that they must either surrender or suffer the same fate as [ASTAPOR] .

[TYRION] ['S] fears prove accurate as [SHAE] bluntly tells him that she will no longer sleep with him after he weds [SANSA] . 
meanwhile , [TYWIN LANNISTER] enters the [THRONE] room to answer a summons from king [JOFFREY] . after exchanging some false courtesy [TYWIN LANNISTER] asks why his grandson wished to see him . [JOFFREY] wants an update on what the [SMALL COUNCIL] has been doing . [TYWIN LANNISTER] informs [JOFFREY] that the king can attend any [SMALL COUNCIL] meeting should he desire it . the [BOY] king claims that he is too busy to attend said meetings and demands to know why the location of the [SMALL COUNCIL] meetings has changed . [TYWIN LANNISTER] says that he is holding the meeting in the [TOWER] of the [HAND] to save time . when [JOFFREY] complains that he would have to [CLIMB] too many steps should he wish to sit in on a [SMALL COUNCIL] meeting , [TYWIN LANNISTER] silently ascends the steps to stand next to the [THRONE] , silently glares down at [JOFFREY] , and then sardonically says he could arrange to have [JOFFREY] carried . a disconcerted [JOFFREY] changes the subject to [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] [TYWIN LANNISTER] is surprised that [JOFFREY] even knows about the exiled princess . [TYWIN LANNISTER] admits the reports are apparently true that the last [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] is not only alive , but has successfully hatched the [FIRST] live [DRAGONS] the world has seen in almost [TWO] centuries . [JOFFREY] is puzzled at why [TYWIN LANNISTER] doesn't think they should do anything about her , but [TYWIN LANNISTER] reminds [JOFFREY] that the last [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] [DRAGONS] were stunted inbred creatures who weren't a threat to anyone , and [DAENERYS TARGARYEN]' [DRAGONS] are probably just curiosities at best , not [GRAND] weapons of war . moreover , [TYWIN LANNISTER] says that even if [DAENERYS TARGARYEN]' [DRAGONS] do turn out to be as strong as the [DRAGONS] of centuries [LONG] ago , they are on the far side of the world and no threat to [JOFFREY] ['S] rule . [TYWIN LANNISTER] also warns his grandson that he should heed his advisor's [SMALL COUNCIL] on matters he does not comprehend . when [JOFFREY] protests that he hasn't been counseled on anything , [TYWIN LANNISTER] says he is being advised at this very moment and says that he will inform [JOFFREY] should he deem it necessary . before taking his leave [TYWIN LANNISTER] smiles slightly with an even slighter bow leaving a browbeaten [JOFFREY] squirming on the [IRON THRONE] . their exchange leaves no doubt as to who is really ruling the kingdom . 
at [HARRENHAL] , [JAIME] speaks one last time to [BRIENNE] before he leaves . [JAIME] remarks that he owes [BRIENNE] a debt for both keeping him alive on their journey and for giving him a reason to live to rouse him from his suicidal depression after losing his [HAND] . [BRIENNE] tells [JAIME] to repay his debt by keeping his pledge . [JAIME] promises that he will [RED KEEP] his word to return [CATELYN STARK] ['S] daughters to her . 
the next day , [JAIME] leaves [HARRENHAL] in the company of [QYBURN] who is to accompany [JAIME] to continue treating his arm in the hopes of getting his maester's chain restored through lord [TYWIN LANNISTER] ['S] influence [JAIME] jokes that his father will make [QYBURN] [GRAND] maester if he grows [JAIME] a [NEW] [HAND] and a number of [BOLTON] soldiers under the command of [STEELSHANKS] , one of lord [BOLTON] ['S] captains . lord [ROOSE BOLTON] , who is also about to depart [HARRENHAL] for the [TWINS] , under orders from [ROBB STARK] , requests that [JAIME] pass on his regards to [TYWIN LANNISTER] [JAIME] asks that [ROOSE BOLTON] do the same for him with [ROBB STARK] . [LOCKE] , who has been left in charge of the [CASTLE] in [ROOSE BOLTON] ['S] absence , can't resist poking fun at the departing [JAIME] and sneers that he will'take good care' of [BRIENNE] , though [JAIME] doesn't rise to the bait . 
when their party makes camp , as [QYBURN] checks [JAIME] ['S] stump , [JAIME] questions how the former maester lost his chain . [QYBURN] explains that he lost it for performing vivisections on the sick and dying in a bid to better understand illness . [JAIME] is disgusted by this revelation , but [QYBURN] counters what he learned has saved numerous more lives and questions [JAIME] on how many he has killed compared to how many he's saved . [JAIME] responds that he has probably killed thousands , but he saved half a million lives when he killed the [MAD] king to save the population of king's [LANDING] , much to [QYBURN] ['S] surprise . 
 [JAIME] then asks about [BRIENNE] [QYBURN] confirms that they sent a [RAVEN] to her father , lord [SELWYN] [TARTH] , and he offered a ransom of 300 gold [DRAGONS] for his daughter's safe return . however , [LOCKE] refused the offer still under the misapprehension that [TARTH] owns every sapphire mine in [WESTEROS] , [LOCKE] is convinced lord [SELWYN] is trying to cheat him . when [QYBURN] mentions that most of the [MEN] would rather get some meager entertainment out of killing [BRIENNE] before they [DIE] in [BATTLE] or [WINTER] , [JAIME] , feeling guilty because his lie to protect [BRIENNE] has invertantly placed her in greater danger , urges [STEELSHANKS] to return to [HARRENHAL] . though the [MAN] initially refuses , [JAIME] uses the promise of a reward and the threat of [TYWIN LANNISTER] ['S] retribution to convince him to go back . 
upon arriving at [HARRENHAL] , [JAIME] is shocked and furious to find [LOCKE] and his cronies have thrown [BRIENNE] into a [BEAR] [PIT] , facing an angry [BEAR] with only a wooden sword to defend herself , as they all mockingly sing the [BEAR] and the [MAIDEN FAIR] . [JAIME] orders [LOCKE] to pull her out and offers to pay whatever ransom he wants , but [LOCKE] dismisses the offer , getting more satisfaction out of the spectacle of [BRIENNE] being torn apart . in desperation , [JAIME] leaps into the [PIT] to help her before the [BEAR] can harm either of them , [STEELSHANKS] shoots it with a crossbow , distracting the beast [LONG] enough for [JAIME] and [BRIENNE] to be pulled out of the [PIT] . [LOCKE] tries to stop them from leaving , but [JAIME] angrily tells him that lord [ROOSE BOLTON] cares more about getting him back to king's [LANDING] alive than keeping one of his pet thugs happy , and backed up by [STEELSHANKS] and his [MEN] , [LOCKE] is unable to stop them . [JAIME] then departs [HARRENHAL] with his escort and [BRIENNE] in tow .

 [DAENERYS] , [JORAH] and [BARRISTAN] hide behind a ruined building to spy on the encampment of the [SECOND SONS] , a professional mercenary company , the powerful friends the yunkish have employed . [BARRISTAN] explains that although there are only 2 , 000 of them , the [SECOND SONS] are armored and mounted , enough to cause trouble for the [UNSULLIED] . [DAENERYS] tells [BARRISTAN] to organize a meeting with the [SECOND SONS]' captains , saying that [MEN] who fight for gold can't afford to lose to a girl . 
shortly thereafter , [DAENERYS] hosts the captains [MERO] , a [BRAAVOSI] also known as the [TITAN] ['S] bastard , and [PRENDAHL] na ghezn , a ghiscari . also in attendance is [PRENDAHL] ['S] capable and striking lieutenant , [DAARIO] [NAHARIS] . the uncouth and sexually vulgar [MERO] makes himself at [HOME] , observes that [DAENERYS] looks like a whore he knows in [LYS] and feels up [MISSANDEI] , although the surprisingly gracious queen shrugs his insults off . [PRENDAHL] and [MERO] refuse [DAENERYS]' offer of an alliance , pointing out they will not get their rewards until she reclaims the [IRON THRONE] , which is still a distant prospect . with aplomb she replies that a fortnight previous she had no [ARMY] , and a year before that she had no [DRAGONS] . smiling gently she gives them [TWO] days to make a decision and sends them off with a barrel of wine [MERO] had demanded . [DAARIO] smiles over his back at her as they depart . once the sellswords are gone , [DAENERYS] drops her pretence of cordiality and while glowering at [MERO] ['S] back , instructs [BARRISTAN] that if they must fight the [SECOND SONS] , he is to [KILL] [MERO] [FIRST] . [SELMY] replies that he would be glad to do so . 
at the mercenary camp , [MERO] fondles a yunkish pleasure slave while discussing the situation with [PRENDAHL] and [DAARIO] . it swiftly becomes apparent that [DAARIO] and [MERO] do not agree , but [PRENDAHL] cuts off their philosophical discussion to call for action over the dragon bitch . they eventually decide to simply assassinate [DAENERYS] and be done with it . [MERO] gives the slave [THREE] coins , one each from [VOLANTIS] , [MEEREEN] , and [BRAAVOS] , and tells her to randomly give them to the [THREE] mercenaries the one who gets the [BRAAVOSI] coin will [KILL] the queen .

that [NIGHT] , as [DAENERYS] bathes , she is surprised to learn that [MISSANDEI] speaks no fewer than nineteen languages . [MISSANDEI] says this shouldn't be that odd , since it only took [DAENERYS] a year to gain a reasonable grasp of [DOTHRAKI] . the khaleesi bristles at the idea she speaks only reasonable [DOTHRAKI] and switches to the language to teach [MISSANDEI] a lesson , only to have her pronunciation corrected . suddenly , an [UNSULLIED] enters and [HOLD] a knife to [MISSANDEI] ['S] throat , advising the women not to scream . he removes his helmet , revealing himself as [DAARIO] . he explains that he is here to [KILL] [DAENERYS] on orders from his captains , but they ran into a philosophical disagreement over her beauty . he then produces their severed heads . intrigued , [DAENERYS] rises from her bath and asks if [DAARIO] will swear fealty to her . he bends the knee and swears his sword , his [MEN] and his heart to [DAENERYS] .

 [ARYA STARK] , now a captive of [SANDOR CLEGANE] after he kidnapped her from the [BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS] , picks up a [ROCK] and stands over him planning to strike . she thinks he is sound asleep . he opens his eyes and tells her she has one chance to hit him , and [KILL] him , but if she fails he will break her hands . later she sits on the horse with him sullen and refusing food he offers her . [SANDOR CLEGANE] points out that for all she hates him , [ARYA STARK] could have been taken captive by someone far worse . he tells her about [SANSA] and how he rescued her from a group of would be rapists . [ARYA STARK] disbelieves this , but [SANDOR CLEGANE] says ask your sister if you ever see her again . they arrive at a river which [ARYA STARK] initially thinks to be the [BLACKWATER] . rather confused with her lack of understanding he points out that the river is the [RED FORK] of the [TRIDENT] . [ARYA STARK] believed he was taking her back to king's [LANDING] , but he reveals that he is in fact taking her to the [TWINS] , where her [MOTHER] and brother will shortly be attending her uncle's [WEDDING] , and he will ransom her to them . he tells her ruefully that if she wasn't so busy trying to [KILL] him they might make it in time for the [WEDDING] . [ARYA STARK] has a [SMALL] and hidden smile as the [HOUND] spurs the horse to a gallop . 
 [MELISANDRE] finally arrives back at [DRAGONSTONE] with [GENDRY] in tow . [STANNIS] is less than impressed by the [SIGHT] of the bastard [BOY] who is technically his nephew and is bemused when [MELISANDRE] orders him fed , bathed and clothed . he believes it is pointless as they intend to sacrifice him , but [MELISANDRE] reveals it is merely a sham to [KEEP] [GENDRY] feeling secure , in much the same way as keeping a sacrificial lamb from seeing the blade of the knife . 
meanwhile , [DAVOS] seaworth , still languishing in his cell , is paid a visit by [STANNIS] [DAVOS] is told of the impending sacrifice of [GENDRY] . [DAVOS] protests this saying that unlike [RENLY] who was a rebel against his rightful king , [GENDRY] is an innocent who has [NEVER] done him any wrong . [STANNIS] argues that the sacrifice of one bastard [BOY] will usher in his victory , which [STANNIS] believes is the only way to save every [MAN] , [WOMAN] and child in [WESTEROS] from the [COMING] darkness that will devour everything in its path . he asks how [DAVOS] can doubt the power of [MELISANDRE] ['S] [GOD] when [STANNIS] has seen visions of a [GREAT] [BATTLE] in the [SNOW] and [DAVOS] saw the creature she gave birth to . [DAVOS] speculates that the real reason [STANNIS] came is because deep down , a part of him knows what he's about to do is wrong and he knew [DAVOS] would tell him the truth he needs to hear , regardless of how it would be taken . after extracting a promise from [DAVOS] that he won't act against [MELISANDRE] again , [STANNIS] has him released . 
 [STANNIS] naming the 3 usurpers . 
in [GENDRY] ['S] quarters , [MELISANDRE] seduces [GENDRY] [LONG] enough to distract him , then promptly ties him to the bed and places leeches on his body . she explains as [STANNIS] and [DAVOS] enter the room that [DAVOS] wanted a demonstration of the power in king's [BLOOD] , then removes the leeches and lights a [FIRE] in a nearby brazier . as part of the magical ritual that follows , [STANNIS] throws the leeches into the flames at [MELISANDRE] ['S] direction , and recites the names of [THREE] people he wants [DEAD] as they burn the usurper [ROBB STARK] , the usurper [BALON GREYJOY] , the usurper [JOFFREY BARATHEON] . 
at king's [LANDING] , [TYRION] speaks with [SANSA] before their [WEDDING] at the [GREAT SEPT] of [BAELOR] though he knows the girl is not thrilled at the prospect of marrying him . [TYRION] promises [SANSA] that he will not mistreat her , and [SANSA] agrees there are worse [LANNISTERS] she could be wed to . prior to the [WEDDING] , [MARGAERY TYRELL] tries to ingratiate herself to [CERSEI] , commenting they will technically be [SISTERS] soon [CERSEI] responds by telling [MARGAERY TYRELL] the story behind the [RAINS] of [CASTAMERE] , relating how it refers to the destruction of [HOUSE] [REYNE] of [CASTAMERE] after their failed [REBELLION] against [HOUSE LANNISTER] inferring similarities between the ambitions and position of [HOUSES] [REYNE] and [MARGAERY TYRELL] and that the same fate [MAY] fall upon [HOUSE TYRELL] if they plot against the [LANNISTERS] and concludes by threatening to have [MARGAERY TYRELL] strangled in her sleep if she ever dares call [CERSEI] sister again . the ceremony is a grim affair [JOFFREY BARATHEON] smugly escorts [SANSA] to the altar in place of her father and petulantly removes the stool upon which [TYRION] was to stand on to cloak [SANSA] in [HOUSE LANNISTER] colors as part of the ceremony , eliciting snickers from the congregation though the scowl of lord [TYWIN] quickly silences them . [TYRION] in the face of humiliation asks [SANSA] to kneel and he places the cloak around her shoulders . the [NEW] [HIGH SEPTON] begins the ceremony . later as [WOMAN] and wife they have their reception dinner , which also proves a grim and miserable affair . 
tyrions threatens [JOFFREY BARATHEON] . 
 [TYRION] spends the [WEDDING] feast mostly by getting deeply drunk and making [LIGHT] of his father's insistence that his inebriated state will render him unfit to impregnate his wife . [TYRION] , drunkenly proclaiming himself the [GOD] of tits and wine , reminds his father that [TYWIN] has [LONG] called him a drunken little lust filled beast , so doing his duty in the marriage bed will not pose a problem . at the same time , [JOFFREY BARATHEON] is himself drinking too much wine , and losing what few inhibitions he has , his behavior becomes increasingly offensive to both [SANSA] and [TYRION] . against [CERSEI] ['S] ineffectual protests , [JOFFREY BARATHEON] gets up and , flanked by his [KINGSGUARD] , taunts [SANSA] that she's still found a way to marry a [HOUSE LANNISTER] . [JOFFREY BARATHEON] then ponders that it doesn't matter which [HOUSE LANNISTER] gets her pregnant , and openly says he might want to rape her after [TYRION] is done with her , while the [KINGSGUARD] [HOLD] her down . 
 [JOFFREY BARATHEON] then declares it time for the bedding ceremony which involves the [MEN] at the [WEDDING] stripping the bride and the women stripping the groom before carrying them off to the marriage bed but [TYRION] angrily insists there will be no bedding ceremony . when [JOFFREY BARATHEON] keeps pushing the matter , [TYRION] slams his dagger into the table and threatens that [JOFFREY BARATHEON] will be fucking his own bride with a wooden cock if he doesn't let it drop . as the court stands in shocked silence , [JOFFREY BARATHEON] seethes with outrage and [TYRION] defiantly glares at his nephew with pure hatred . after a tense moment , [TYWIN] defuses the situation by agreeing that there will be no bedding ceremony , and placates [JOFFREY BARATHEON] by claiming [TYRION] ['S] outburst is merely the result of his being extremely drunk . taking the hint , [TYRION] visibly swallows his anger and begins to act far more drunk than he actually is , intentionally humiliating himself , and says he only made a bad joke . it isn't clear if anyone in the room , including [TYWIN] or [JOFFREY BARATHEON] , think that [TYRION] ['S] outburst was simply due to being very drunk , but everyone plays along anyway to help the tension pass . [TYRION] , while pretending to be so drunk he can barely stand , escorts [SANSA] to their bedchamber . 
once they are alone in their quarters , a tense moment passes as [SANSA] nervously and slowly undresses . [TYRION] ultimately tells her to stop , deciding that he will not consummate the marriage if she does not want to , and only will if she changes her mind . when [SANSA] questions what he will do if she [NEVER] does , [TYRION] sarcastically jokes and so my [WATCH] begins implying that his marriage will be celibate for all time like a brother of the [NIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] and then abruptly passes out on a nearby couch . the following morning , [SHAE] notices with a hint of a smile that [SANSA] ['S] bed sheets are not stained with [BLOOD] and [TYRION] ['S] virgin bride is still a virgin .

at the [TWINS] , the carnage at the [RED WEDDING] continues to unfold . while the [NORTHERN] lords are being slaughtered in the main [HALL] , [OUTSIDE] the walls of the [CASTLE] [HOUSE FREY] soldiers ambush the [ROBB STARK] [ARMY] in its own camp . what follows is not a [BATTLE] but a one sided massacre as the [NORTHERN] [ARMY] is taken completely by surprise due to the betrayal of their supposed allies . the betrayers torch all of the camp's tents , with many [MEN] burning alive inside of them . [HOUSE FREY] [MEN] wildly mutilate the [DEAD] and dying . from one of the twin towers of the [HOUSE FREY] stronghold , [ROOSE BOLTON] watches the massacre . 
 [ROBB STARK] ['S] corpse desecrated , with his direwolf's head sewn in place of his own . 
 [SANDOR CLEGANE] attempts to slip away amidst the carnage on a horse , along with the unconscious [ARYA STARK] , by casually riding away while carrying a [HOUSE FREY] banner . before they can leave , [ARYA STARK] regains consciousness as she and the [HOUND] turn to see a group of [HOUSE FREY] [MEN] shouting as they march through the main [GATE] . the [FREYS] have horrifically desecrated [ROBB STARK] ['S] corpse by decapitating it , then crudely attaching the severed head of his direwolf [GREY WIND] in its place . drunk with victory , the [FREYS] gleefully parade the mutilated body around the [CASTLE] on a horse while mockingly chanting king in the [NORTH] king in the [NORTH] here he comes , the king in the [NORTH] , which is met with by cheers and peals of laughter from the crowds of [HOUSE FREY] soldiers . 
 [SANDOR CLEGANE] is horrified by the gruesome spectacle , while he holds [ARYA STARK] , who looks on with a [DEAD] stare . the [HOUND] rides away with her , undisturbed thanks to the [HOUSE FREY] banner in his [HAND] . 
in the [GREAT] [HALL] of the [CASTLE] the following morning , as servants clean up the pools of [BLOOD] left by their former [RED WEDDING] guests , lords [WALDER FREY] and [ROOSE BOLTON] gloat over their victory and the rewards their treachery has won them . [WALDER FREY] will become lord of [RIVERRUN] , and the [FREYS] will replace the tullys as the [LANNISTERS]' vassals in the [RIVERLANDS] . [ROOSE BOLTON] has been appointed as the [NEW] warden of the [NORTH] , replacing the [STARKS] though [TYWIN LANNISTER] intends to eventually give the position to a future [TYWIN LANNISTER] heir produced by [TYRION LANNISTER] and [SANSA STARK] . 
 [ROOSE BOLTON] expresses his concern that [BRYNDEN] [HOUSE TULLY] escaped the massacre , but [WALDER FREY] dismisses his worries , pointing out that the [BLACKFISH] and the remaining [HOUSE TULLY] garrison at [RIVERRUN] is alone and outnumbered against the combined strength of the [LANNISTERS] , [BOLTONS] , and [FREYS] , although [ROOSE BOLTON] is still visibly concerned . [ROOSE BOLTON] makes plain his contempt for [ROBB STARK] , considering the late [BOY] king arrogant , politically incompetent , and unwilling to take [ROOSE BOLTON] ['S] advice and make the hard decisions needed to [TYWIN LANNISTER] . [WALDER FREY] questions [ROOSE BOLTON] if he intends to rule the [NORTH] from [WINTERFELL] , and he says that he might move his ruling seat there at some future time , after it is rebuilt . this leads [WALDER FREY] to ask how [WINTERFELL] [ENDED] up a ruin . [ROOSE BOLTON] explains that his bastard son [RAMSAY SNOW] offered [ROBB STARK] ['S] terms that the [IRONBORN] occupiers would be shown [MERCY] if they handed over [THEON GREYJOY] , but when they did they learned that [RAMSAY SNOW] , in his father's [WORDS] , has his own way of doing [THINGS] . 
at the [DREADFORT] , [RAMSAY SNOW] eats his breakfast of a thick sausage , taunting [THEON GREYJOY] about his recent emasculation by pointing to his sewn up and [BLOOD] stained trousers , and laughing as [THEON GREYJOY] finally begs for death as a release from the nightmare . [RAMSAY SNOW] tells him that he is more valuable alive than [DEAD] so the answer must be no . [RAMSAY SNOW] notes that [THEON GREYJOY] reeks , and decides that that shall be his [NEW] [NAME] [REEK] . [THEON GREYJOY] refuses to acknowledge the [NAME] , twice insisting that he is [THEON GREYJOY] , but after [RAMSAY SNOW] beats him , he finally breaks down and says his [NAME] is [REEK] . 
on [PYKE] , [BALON GREYJOY] reads a message from lord [ROOSE BOLTON] ['S] bastard while his daughter [YARA] [BALON GREYJOY] cautiously opens a box crudely carved with the [BALON GREYJOY] kraken . as [RAMSAY SNOW] ['S] letter explains the box contains [THEON GREYJOY] ['S] favorite toy . the message bluntly says that the [IRONBORN] have until the full [MOON] to withdraw from the [NORTH] or receive more bits and pieces of [THEON GREYJOY] . in addition any remaining [IRONBORN] will be flayed alive just as [RAMSAY SNOW] flayed alive [THEON GREYJOY] ['S] twenty [IRONBORN] followers at [WINTERFELL] after they surrendered , even though he had promised them safe passage . it was in fact [RAMSAY SNOW] and his soldiers from [HOUSE BOLTON] who burned [WINTERFELL] to the ground he simply sent false reports for his father [ROOSE BOLTON] to deliver to [ROBB STARK] which claimed that the [IRONBORN] were responsible , as the [BOLTONS] were preparing to betray the [STARKS] months before the [RED WEDDING] . 
 [BALON GREYJOY] acts indifferent to [THEON GREYJOY] ['S] situation since he defied [BALON GREYJOY] ['S] orders and [YARA] ['S] common sense when he stayed at [WINTERFELL] . furthermore , he can not further the [BALON GREYJOY] line as the contents of the box prove . however , [YARA] does not share her father's attitude toward her last living brother . she announces her intention to take her fastest ship with her fifty best [MEN] , sail around [WESTEROS] , besiege the [DREADFORT] , and liberate [THEON GREYJOY] . 
in the [RIVERLANDS] , a despondent [ARYA STARK] and [SANDOR CLEGANE] ride away from the outskirts of the [TWINS] . they pass close to a [SMALL] group of [WALDER FREY] [MEN] , one of whom is bragging about being one of the [MEN] who cut off [GREY WIND] ['S] head and attached it to [ROBB STARK] ['S] body . [ARYA STARK] approaches them and sweetly asks to warm herself by the [FIRE] . she offers the coin given to her by [JAQEN H] ['GHAR] as payment . when the [WALDER FREY] [MAN] investigates , she stabs him in the [NECK] . slightly thrown , the [HOUND] deals with the others before demanding to know where [ARYA STARK] got the knife . she reveals it's his . he admonishes her to let him know the next time she plans to do something like that . as he grumbles and cleans up the bodies , [ARYA STARK] whispers , [VALAR MORGHULIS] . 
meanwhile , in king's [LANDING] , [TYRION LANNISTER] and [SANSA STARK] [WALK] through the [GARDENS] . a pair of passing gentlemen snigger at [TYRION LANNISTER] , either for his dwarf status or due to rumors he has not consummated his marriage . [SANSA STARK] tells him to pay them no mind . [TYRION LANNISTER] reminds [SANSA STARK] that he's used to it , as he's always been a dwarf . he also states that he's not [JOFFREY] , [TYRION LANNISTER] would rather bide his time and humiliate them . [SANSA STARK] playfully follows his line of thinking , and suggests sheep shifting secretly hiding sheep's dung deep within a mattress as [ARYA STARK] used to do to her , so that the target always wakes up smelling of dung . [TYRION LANNISTER] is amused but is confused by the term , though he realizes belatedly that [SANSA STARK] has misheard the word shit . he is rescued from having to explain his wife's mistake by [PODRICK] [PAYNE] , who calls him to a meeting of the [SMALL COUNCIL] . 
in [TYWIN] ['S] chambers [GRAND] maester [PYCELLE] dithers over giving [TYRION LANNISTER] a coded message from lord [JOFFREY] . [JOFFREY] jubilantly explains its meaning that [ROBB STARK] and [CATELYN STARK] are both [DEAD] . [TYRION LANNISTER] is visibly startled by the news , already foreseeing the [LONG] term problems that the incident will cause , but [JOFFREY] brushes him off and gleefully states that he intends to serve [ROBB STARK] ['S] severed head to [SANSA STARK] at his [RED WEDDING] feast . none of the [SMALL COUNCIL] are able to mask how distasteful they find the concept . [VARYS] points out that [SANSA STARK] is [JOFFREY] ['S] aunt by marriage now and it would be unseemly not to give her the basic respect that accords . 
a deeply embarrassed [CERSEI] forces a smile and insists to the rest of the [SMALL COUNCIL] that [JOFFREY] was only joking and did not mean it . this puzzles [JOFFREY] , who matter of factly states to his [MOTHER] that he did mean it , and he will have [ROBB STARK] ['S] head served at his [RED WEDDING] feast . [TYRION LANNISTER] flatly forbids it and tells [JOFFREY] that [SANSA STARK] isn't his to torment anymore . [JOFFREY] angrily proclaims that he is the king , and everyone is his to torment . [TYWIN] counters that a king who has to remind his subjects that he is the king , is no king . [JOFFREY] goes apoplectic and tries to fight his grandfather , deriding [TYWIN] as a coward who hid under [CASTERLY ROCK] while [JOFFREY] ['S] father king [ROBERT] won the real war when he overthrew the [TARGARYENS] . the entire [SMALL COUNCIL] tenses waiting for [TYWIN] to respond to this shocking insult instead [TYWIN] coldly and calmly declares that the king is tired and advises the queen regent to see him to bed . [JOFFREY] weakly protests that he is not tired but leaves with his [MOTHER] , and [TYWIN] also asks [PYCELLE] to give his grandson a sedative to make sure he goes to sleep . 
 [TYWIN] dismisses the rest of the [SMALL COUNCIL] , save [TYRION LANNISTER] , who drily notes that the lord of the [SEVEN KINGDOMS] has been sent to bed [WITHOUT] his supper . he confronts [TYWIN] about his part in the [RED WEDDING] , and deduces that his father must have orchestrated it , as [WALDER FREY] is not brave enough to have carried it out on his own . the [HAND] blithely confirms this . he dismisses [TYRION LANNISTER] ['S] concerns that the [NORTHERNERS] will [NEVER] forget nor forgive such an outrage , arguing he wants them to remember so that it will make them wary of rebelling again . [TYRION LANNISTER] shows his distaste for [TYWIN] ['S] choice of a [RED WEDDING] as the place to inflict the slaughter , but [TYWIN] responds , asking why killing ten thousand soldiers in [BATTLE] is nobler than killing a dozen guests at a [RED WEDDING] . 
 [TYWIN] again waxes poetic about family , noting [TYRION LANNISTER] ['S] failure to consummate his marriage to [SANSA STARK] . [TYRION LANNISTER] refuses to force himself on [SANSA STARK] to do his duty , and notes that she is hardly likely to warm to him now that the [LANNISTERS] have murdered her [MOTHER] and brother . [TYRION LANNISTER] demands to know when [TYWIN] ever put the family's interests above his own . [TYWIN] retorts that he did exactly that on the day that [TYRION LANNISTER] was born he wanted to throw his newborn son into the [SEA] , but instead he spared him and raised him as his son , because he is a [TYRION LANNISTER] . 
immediately after leaving , [TYRION LANNISTER] returns to his chambers and calls for [SANSA STARK] , who simply regards him with a forlorn , tear streaked face confirming that she was already informed of her family's death . [TYRION LANNISTER] backs out , knowing that his sympathy would be rather cold comfort . 
elsewhere in the [RED KEEP] , [VARYS] meets with [SHAE] . he tells her that he knows she is genuinely in love with [TYRION LANNISTER] and that is why she should take the diamonds he offers her and leave immediately for essos to build a [NEW] , lavish life for herself . [VARYS] is convinced that [TYRION LANNISTER] is the last hope for the [SEVEN KINGDOMS]' current regime , therefore [SHAE] is a weakness that [TYRION LANNISTER] , and thus the [REALM] , can not afford . [SHAE] confirms that she is in love with [TYRION LANNISTER] and that she cares deeply for [SANSA STARK] as well , but in spite of her pain at seeing them together and the danger she poses , [SHAE] will not leave until or unless [TYRION LANNISTER] asks her to . 
unknown to everyone in king's [LANDING] , [JAIME LANNISTER] , [BRIENNE] of [TARTH] , and [QYBURN] finally arrive the [CITY] [FOLK] do not even recognize [JAIME LANNISTER] after his [LONG] absence from the capital . they make their way to the [RED KEEP] , where [JAIME LANNISTER] immediately calls on [CERSEI] , who regards him with a confused look as she takes in his disheveled appearance and missing [HAND] . 
at [DRAGONSTONE] , ser [DAVOS] seaworth tests his [NEW] found literacy on [STANNIS BARATHEON] ['S] correspondence , declining [SHIREEN] [STANNIS BARATHEON] ['S] invitation to read more tales of [AEGON] i [TARGARYEN] . he expresses dissatisfaction about the odd spelling of the word [NIGHT] , before hearing the horns that signal [MELISANDRE] ['S] intents to sacrifice [GENDRY] . he argues with [STANNIS BARATHEON] again about sacrificing the [BOY] , but [STANNIS BARATHEON] is convinced by [MELISANDRE] that using [GENDRY] as part of her [BLOOD] magic will give him the power to destroy his enemies and claim the [IRON THRONE] . when he doesn't get through to his liege , [DAVOS] takes matters into his own hands and frees the [BOY] , giving him a rowboat and directions to king's [LANDING] . a furious [STANNIS BARATHEON] sentences [DAVOS] to death but the [ONION KNIGHT] produces a letter from the [ONION KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] . [DAVOS] insists that it is [STANNIS BARATHEON]' duty to assist the [BLACK] [BROTHERS] , and that he will need [DAVOS] ['S] assistance to rally troops and mercenaries . [MELISANDRE] burns the letter and acknowledges the truth the war of the [FIVE KINGS] is irrelevant . the true war lies in the [NORTH] , and evil and death are marching on the [WALL] . she also agrees that [DAVOS] has an important role to play in the events to [COME] . [STANNIS BARATHEON] sarcastically laughs at r'hllor's sense of humor , noting that the [GOD] [DAVOS] likes to mock has chosen him for a higher purpose .

[SAM] defends himself by reciting the [ONION KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] oath to protect the realms of [MEN] whatever side of the [WALL] they are on and repeating [JEOR MORMONT] ['S] assertion that a [WALL] of [ICE] 500 miles [LONG] and 700 feet [HIGH] was not built to [KEEP] out barbarians . [AEMON] ['S] demeanor softens upon learning that [GILLY] was one of [CRASTER] ['S] wives , and acknowledges that she is now a refugee and should be sheltered . [AEMON] then orders [SAM] to begin writing letters immediately and make sure that all forty four of [CASTLE BLACK] ['S] ravens are well fed , as every one of them is to fly that [ONION KNIGHT] the [WHITE WALKERS] have returned , and [WESTEROS] must be warned .

[JON SNOW] tries to talk [YGRITTE] out of shooting him , insisting that he still loves her but that she should have known his loyalty to the [WATCH] was [NEVER] gone . though his feelings are clearly reciprocated , [YGRITTE] is still angered by his betrayal and shoots [JON SNOW] [THREE] times with her bow as he flees from her , watching him go with tears in her eyes . 
 [JON SNOW] is badly injured , but his horse manages to carry him the rest of the way to [CASTLE BLACK] , as he hovers in and out of consciousness . having reached safety , [JON SNOW] is brought inside the [CASTLE BLACK] by the guards , where he encounters [SAM] and [PYPAR] , who are overjoyed to see him and insist that his injuries be taken care of .

[JON SNOW] snaps back , acknowledging that he talks like a wildling and also admits to living amongst the [WILDLINGS] , eating with them , and climbing the [WALL] with them . he catches himself before admitting that he lay with one , but says it anyway . [JANOS SLYNT] calls for [JON SNOW] ['S] execution for breaking one of his vows . [AEMON] points out the impracticality of executing every ranger who lays with a girl and says that the [WALL] would be manned by headless [MEN] . [ALLISER THORNE] says that there is a difference between sneaking off to a brothel and sleeping with the enemy . 
 [JON SNOW] does not defend himself at this point . instead , he says that [MANCE RAYDER] intends to attack the [NIGHT] ['S] [CITY WATCH] with his [ARMY] of 100 , 000 [WILDLINGS] and gives intelligence on [MANCE RAYDER] ['S] plan of attack . both [ALLISER THORNE] and [JANOS SLYNT] disbelieve what [JON SNOW] has to say . [AEMON] , however , realizes that [JON SNOW] is speaking the truth , and the hearing ends with [JON SNOW] being allowed to [KEEP] his head , although after [JON SNOW] leaves , [ALLISER THORNE] expresses his distrust for [JON SNOW] .

 [ARYA STARK] and the [HOUND] [SANDOR CLEGANE] are still traveling through the [RIVERLANDS] on a single horse . they pass by overturned carts and [DEAD] bodies , including those of [CHILDREN] . [ARYA STARK] asks when she is going to get her own horse , complaining of the [HOUND] ['S] stench . he scoffs at the idea , noting that horses are hard to [COME] by and that he wouldn't give [ARYA STARK] her own horse even if one was available as she is the only thing of value he has since he did not take anything of value when he left king's [LANDING] . [ARYA STARK] assures him she has no plans to run off , saying that she would [DIE] by nightfall [WITHOUT] him as she has no one to go to . the [HOUND] reminds her that she still has an aunt in the [VALE] , [LYSA ARRYN] , to whom he plans to ransom [ARYA STARK] . 
the [TWO] eventually [COME] upon a tavern . both hungry , [ARYA STARK] suggests that they attack the [MEN] there , to which the [HOUND] expresses reluctance as there are [FIVE] [MEN] . just then , [TWO] [MEN] exit to relieve themselves . [ARYA STARK] recognizes one of them as [POLLIVER] , the [LANNISTER] [MAN] at arms who had previously taken [ARYA STARK] ['S] sword [NEEDLE] and killed her friend [LOMMY] . she also notices that [POLLIVER] still has [NEEDLE] and runs off to get it back . the [HOUND] chases after her , stopping her at the tavern's [DOOR] , but they are seen and choose to go in anyways . 
it is clear that [POLLIVER] and the other [MEN] are making trouble and intend to rape the tavern owner's daughter . [ARYA STARK] and the [HOUND] go to a table far away from everyone else , but [POLLIVER] still recognizes the [HOUND] and walks over to their table and strikes up a conversation . he does not recognize [ARYA STARK] , who he thinks is just the [HOUND] ['S] latest sexual conquest . [POLLIVER] implies that he and his [MEN] intend to rape and pillage on their way back to king's [LANDING] and invites the [HOUND] to [COME] along . [POLLIVER] says that he and his [MEN] wear the king's colors and can do whatever they like , to which the [HOUND] leans forward and states emphatically , [FUCK] the king . 
the conversation then becomes tense and turns into a standoff . they eventually draw their [SWORDS] . at [FIRST] , the [HOUND] fights the [FIVE] [MEN] alone while [ARYA STARK] stands in the corner . he easily dispatches [TWO] of them and fights off the rest , stabbing one in the groin . another , however , gets him on the ground , holding a dagger to his throat . the [HOUND] is able to fight him off , stabbing him repeatedly in the head with his own dagger . 
 [ARYA STARK] then joins the fray , smashing a pot over the head of one of the [MEN] and stabbing him with his own [LONG] sword . she then slashes [POLLIVER] ['S] leg from behind , causing him to fall to the ground . [ARYA STARK] takes [NEEDLE] from [POLLIVER] and stands over his prone form . she echoes what he had said to [LOMMY] just before he killed him , though [POLLIVER] still doesn't recognize her and has no idea what she is talking about . [ARYA STARK] then repeats what he had said to her when he took [NEEDLE] fine little blade . maybe i'll pick my teeth with it . it is at that point when [POLLIVER] recognizes her and becomes frightened . [ARYA STARK] then kills [POLLIVER] in the same way he had killed [LOMMY] by driving [NEEDLE] slowly into his throat . [ARYA STARK] and the [HOUND] then leave the tavern , taking with them a horse for [ARYA STARK] and a chicken the [HOUND] wanted .

soon after , [ROOSE BOLTON] arrives at the [DREADFORT] accompanied by a detachment of his [ARMY] , including [LOCKE] and [ROOSE BOLTON] ['S] [NEW] wife , [WALDA] [ROOSE BOLTON] . [RAMSAY SNOW] greets his father and his [NEW] step [MOTHER] as well as privately congratulating [LOCKE] for his maiming of the kingslayer . [ROOSE BOLTON] wants to see [RAMSAY SNOW] ['S] captive [THEON GREYJOY] . 
 [THEON GREYJOY] is brought to [ROOSE BOLTON] ['S] chambers , where [ROOSE BOLTON] is disgusted and angered to learn [RAMSAY SNOW] has tortured and flayed [THEON GREYJOY] as [BALON GREYJOY] ['S] sole surviving male heir , [THEON GREYJOY] was a valuable hostage . [ROOSE BOLTON] notes that while he has been named warden of the [NORTH] , [TYWIN LANNISTER] will not help him reclaim the [NORTH] from the [IRONBORN] , and he had intended on trading [THEON GREYJOY] for [MOAT CAILIN] , a strategically placed fortress on the border between the [NORTH] and the [RIVERLANDS] currently held by [THEON GREYJOY] forces , preventing the main [ROOSE BOLTON] [ARMY] from returning [NORTH] . [RAMSAY SNOW] retorts that he already sent terms and [BALON GREYJOY] refused him . [ROOSE BOLTON] is furious that [RAMSAY SNOW] did so [WITHOUT] his consent , but [RAMSAY SNOW] demonstrates that his actions have made [REEK] docile and unable to betray them . 
after ordering [REEK] to shave him , [RAMSAY SNOW] cajoles him into admitting that [BRAN] and [RICKON] [STARK] are still alive . [RAMSAY SNOW] reminds his father that the boys are now heirs to [HOUSE STARK] ['S] rule of the [NORTH] following [ROBB STARK] ['S] death , and nearly all the [NORTHERNERS] , who are furious at [HOUSE BOLTON] and [HOUSE FREY] ['S] treachery against the [STARKS] , will rally behind [BRAN] and [RICKON] rather than [ROOSE BOLTON] if they learn the boys are alive .

 [ROOSE BOLTON] dispatches [LOCKE] with orders to find and [KILL] [BRAN] and [RICKON] [REEK] suggests that [JON SNOW] might either be sheltering the boys at [CASTLE BLACK] or at least [MAY] know where they have gone , while [RAMSAY SNOW] advocates killing [JON SNOW] as well , given that the fact he has [ROBB STARK] [BLOOD] could lead to him becoming a threat , since the northeners will rally behind him or he will simply seek revenge although harming [JON SNOW] would constitute a grave crime since he is part of the [NIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] and thus legally untouchable by the [SEVEN KINGDOMS] . [ROOSE BOLTON] gives [RAMSAY SNOW] orders as well to take [THEON GREYJOY] and an [ARMY] to [MOAT CAILIN] and reclaim the fortress from the greyjoys . if he succeeds , [ROOSE BOLTON] will give consideration to legitimizing [RAMSAY SNOW] as a member of [HOUSE BOLTON] .

[TYRION] then turns his full fury towards [CERSEI] and says that watching her vicious bastard of a son [DIE] gave him more relief than a thousand lying whores . he then turns around to the court and roars that he wishes to have become the monster they thought he was and would have gladly give his life to [WATCH] everyone [DIE] from drinking poison . this enrages everyone in the court and [TYWIN] orders ser [MERYN TRANT] to escort [TYRION] back to the dungeons . before he can be escorted out , [TYRION] bellows that he will not lose his life for a crime he did not commit and , knowing that he will get no justice from the court , demands a trial by combat . .

however , [OBERYN] stands too close to his seemingly defeated opponent , and [GREGOR CLEGANE] manages to trip and seize him . berserk with fury , [GREGOR CLEGANE] grabs [OBERYN] by the throat and lifts him off the ground , smashing out most of his teeth with a single devastating punch . climbing on top of [OBERYN] , [GREGOR CLEGANE] finally admits for all to hear that he raped and killed [ELIA] as he gouges out [OBERYN] ['S] eyes with his thumbs before crushing the [VIPER] ['S] skull between his hands , which he proclaims having done the same to his sister . as [ELLARIA] screams in horror , a stunned silence sweeps over the crowd . the short joyful moments for [TYRION] and [JAIME] are shattered , as [TYWIN LANNISTER] stands and proclaims the will of the [GODS] is clear [TYRION] is guilty and sentenced to death . [TYRION] can not even reply , shockingly staring in catatonic astonishment at [OBERYN] ['S] skull crushed corpse , as does [JAIME] the only different reaction is from [CERSEI] , who stares at [OBERYN] ['S] slaughtered body , listening to [TYRION] ['S] death sentence while smirking in vindication .

 [JON] and [SAM] are standing [WATCH] atop the [WALL] , staring out into the darkness of the [NORTH] and awaiting the imminent wildling invasion . [SAM] attempts to interrogate [JON] about what it was like to be with a [WOMAN] , stating that as their deaths are likely imminent , it [MAY] be his last chance to find out . [SAM] brings up that the vows of the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] only explicitly forbid members from taking wives or producing [CHILDREN] , and that other activities are open to interpretation . [JON] replies glumly that [ALLISER THORNE] most likely does not care about their interpretations . when further pressed by [SAM] to describe lying down with [YGRITTE] , [JON] attempts to explain but is unable to properly express it , proclaiming exasperatedly that he's not a bleeding poet . 
 [JON] offers to take the [WATCH] up alone so [SAM] can go below , and as [SAM] steps into the elevator and begins to descend the [WALL] , an owl [LANDS] on top of the [WALL] and begins hooting loudly . the owl is revealed to be controlled by a [THENN] warg who is a member of the garrison of [WILDLINGS] under command of [TORMUND] and [STYR] , who have set up camp just [OUTSIDE] of the southern entrance to [CASTLE BLACK] . [TORMUND] boasts about a [BEAR] he supposedly had sex with , prompting [YGRITTE] to cut him short and cast her doubts on the validity of his claim . she tells him that she only cares about getting as many arrows through the hearts of crows as possible . she angrily talks about how the people [SOUTH] of the [WALL] shut the the [WILDLINGS] out by building it and hunting the [WILDLINGS] as enemies she says that now the [WILDLINGS] are the hunters and the southerners their prey . [STYR] mockingly replies that [YGRITTE] has more [WORDS] about killing than she has arrows . she defends herself by saying she killed just as many people at [MOLE] ['S] [TOWN] as he , but [STYR] replies that none of them was her former lover . he further mocks her by saying that when she sees him , she'll likely just serve him a slice of ginger minge , causing her to jump to her feet in anger . [YGRITTE] stares [STYR] down , claiming that she wants to [KILL] [JON SNOW] herself , then looks around the camp and warns the others that she has an arrow ready for anyone else who attempts to [KILL] him . just [OUTSIDE] the camp , a shaded person cradling something passes by the [WILDLINGS] unnoticed . 
maester [AEMON] finds [SAM] in the [CASTLE BLACK] library . meanwhile , [SAM] is caught reading a [BOOK] about [WILDLINGS] by maester [AEMON] . [AEMON] correctly guesses that [SAM] is reading the [BOOK] because he wants to know what kind of fate might have befallen [GILLY] if she fell into wildling hands during the [SACK] of [MOLE] ['S] [TOWN] . he also surmises that [SAM] has shown such a keen interest in her fate because he is in love with her , despite [SAM] ['S] protests to the contrary . [AEMON] muses about the girl he once loved , stating that he can still picture her as clear as day and that she is more real than [SAM] is . after being dismissed by [AEMON] , [SAM] leaves the maester's chambers only to hear [GILLY] at the [GATE] begging to be allowed inside , revealing her survival of the [MOLE] ['S] [TOWN] massacre and her identity as the cloaked figure approaching [CASTLE BLACK] . [PYPAR] attempts to deny her passage into the [CASTLE BLACK] , saying he is not allowed to open the [GATE] under any circumstances . however , [SAM] roars at [PYP] to allow her in , causing [PYP] to relent and let her in . [SAM] promises [GILLY] wherever she goes next he will go too , but their reunion is cut short by [TWO] blows from the horn , indicating that [MANCE] ['S] wildling [ARMY] has finally begun their assault . [SAM] rushes to get [GILLY] safely inside the [CASTLE BLACK] while other [BROTHERS] of the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] prepare for the imminent attack by [WILDLINGS] . 
 [JON SNOW] looking off the top of the [WALL] . 
on top of the [WALL] , [JON SNOW] hears the horn blowing and looks [NORTH] , witnessing a tremendous conflagration to the [NORTH] , just as [MANCE] had promised . [SOUTH] of the [WALL] , the [THENN] warg's owl also spots the [FIRE] and informs [STYR] and [TORMUND] that the time has [COME] to attack [CASTLE BLACK] . [JON SNOW] approaches ser [ALLISER THORNE] , who finally relents and admits that they should have heeded [JON SNOW] ['S] advice and blocked the gates . he grimly muses that leadership often means being [SECOND] guessed by every clever little twat with a mouth and when a [MAN] in charge [SECOND] guesses himself , all is doomed . steeling himself for the impending [SIEGE] , [ALLISER THORNE] begins barking orders to the archers , preparing them to [FIRE] upon the attackers massing below . 
 [SAM] and [GILLY] share a kiss . [SAM] brings [GILLY] and her baby to a storage room where she can hide . [GILLY] wants [SAM] to stay with her as he promised , but he can not as he swore to defend the [WALL] as a brother of the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] . before he leaves her , [GILLY] begs [SAM] to promise her that he won't [DIE] and the [TWO] finally share a kiss . as [SAM] and [PYPAR] are preparing arrows at the southern [GATE] , [PYPAR] laments that he has [NEVER] seen a real [BATTLE] before or ever even held an edged blade . [PYPAR] asks how [SAM] is not afraid , but [SAM] replies that he is , as there are thousands of [WILDLINGS] about to overrun them . [PYPAR] asks how he managed to [KILL] a [WHITE WALKER] while being afraid , and [SAM] says that at that moment , he just had to do something or [GILLY] would have been killed and her baby would have been taken . [SAM] further explains that at that moment , he wasn't himself he was nothing , and when you are nothing there is nothing to be afraid of . however , he explains the reason he is afraid now is because i'm not nothing anymore . 
. 
meanwhile , [YGRITTE] spies on the [CASTLE BLACK] to scout numbers of defenders . she tells the other [WILDLINGS] that most of the guards are at the top of the [WALL] and that few are left in the [CASTLE BLACK] . the group immediately take off towards [CASTLE BLACK] ['S] southern [GATE] , while [YGRITTE] seems to have [SECOND] thoughts . [NORTH] of the [WALL] , the massive wildling [ARMY] emerges from the woods , their numbers including giants riding atop mammoths . [ALLISER THORNE] orders the archers on the [WALL] to nock their arrows , but they draw instead while [GRENN] accidentally drops a barrel down the [WALL] . [ALLISER THORNE] angrily drills his [MEN] on properly following orders when another horn blows from down below at [CASTLE BLACK] , signalling the unanticipated appearance of [TORMUND] ['S] band of [WILDLINGS] at the [CASTLE BLACK] ['S] southern entrance . realizing the dire need for experienced [MEN] to defend the [KEEP] from the surprise attack , [ALLISER THORNE] orders [JANOS SLYNT] to assume command of the [WALL] ['S] defenses and heads below to join the melee . 
below , [TORMUND] and [STYR] ['S] forces charge the [GATE] while [YGRITTE] , acting as a sniper , manages to pick off several [MEN] defending the [GATE] with her bow . [PYPAR] is firing a crossbow as [SAM] assists by reloading another crossbow , but [PYPAR] ['S] aim is poor due to inexperience and nerves and he repeatedly misses his shots . the band of [WILDLINGS] manage to reach [CASTLE BLACK] ['S] walls and begin scaling them using grappling hooks and ropes , forcing [SAM] and [PYP] to retreat . 
 [ALLISER THORNE] arrives with reinforcements from the top of the [WALL] via the wooden lift system , which is being operated by [OLLY] . [ALLISER THORNE] gives an impassioned speech , promising that the ancient order of the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] and [CASTLE BLACK] will survive this [BATTLE] . his speech rallies the [CASTLE BLACK] [BROTHERS] and [ALLISER THORNE] personally leads the charge against the [WILDLINGS] who have breached [CASTLE BLACK] ['S] defenses , causing an intense [BATTLE] to erupt in the courtyard . 
on the [NORTHERN] side of the [WALL] , a wildling strike force led by [TWO] giants one of which is riding a mammoth charge towards [CASTLE BLACK] ['S] outer [GATE] . on top of the [WALL] , [JANOS SLYNT] , having no true leadership experience , breaks down at the [SIGHT] of the massive wildling [ARMY] and begins fumbling his orders . [GRENN] steps in by falsely claiming that [ALLISER THORNE] needs [JANOS SLYNT] back down below . [JANOS SLYNT] believes the lie and leaves , allowing [JON] to take command of the [WALL] ['S] defenses . the [CASTLE BLACK] [BROTHERS] continue to rain down arrows on the advancing [WILDLINGS] , even killing ones that are attempting to scale the [WALL] . one giant , armed with a massive bow , manages to [FIRE] a huge arrow at one of the bunkers atop the [WALL] , completely obliterating it and killing the [CASTLE BLACK] brother manning it the force of the giant's arrow carries the [CASTLE BLACK] brother off the [WALL] on to the other side where he is shoved into ground with a tremendous amount of force . 
 [HOBB] takes up his butcher's knife to defend the dining [HALL] . 
down in [CASTLE BLACK] , the [BATTLE] rages on between the [WILDLINGS] and the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] . [STYR] and [YGRITTE] continue to slay numerous [CASTLE BLACK] [BROTHERS] . at one point , a group of [WILDLINGS] breach [CASTLE BLACK] ['S] dining [HALL] . one wildling is killed when a [CASTLE BLACK] brother throws boiling stew in his face and beats him to death with the pot . [HOBB] , [CASTLE BLACK] ['S] cook , calmly enters the dining [HALL] and kills a wildling with his massive butcher's knife . meanwhile , [JANOS SLYNT] cowardly retreats to a storage room where he discovers [GILLY] and her baby . 
 [SAMWELL TARLY] comforts [PYPAR] as he dies . 
 [PYP] manages to [KILL] a wildling with his crossbow , but is then shot through the [NECK] by [YGRITTE] . [SAM] comforts [PYP] and stays with him until he dies . [SAM] is forced to leave [PYP] ['S] body and as he heads to [CASTLE BLACK] ['S] lift system , but he is spotted by the [THENN] warg . the warg charges at [SAM] as he desperately attempts to load his crossbow , managing to do so and firing a bolt into the warg's head just before he reaches him . meanwhile , [ALLISER THORNE] is locked in a vicious duel with [TORMUND] on the catwalks of [CASTLE BLACK] , both seemingly evenly matched in skill . however , [ALLISER THORNE] suffers a grievous wound and is forced to retreat , being dragged to safety as he continues to shout orders to his [MEN] . 
 [MAG] mar tun doh weg charges [CASTLE BLACK] ['S] inner [GATE] . 
the [CASTLE BLACK] [BROTHERS] defending the [WALL] manage to repel most of the [WILDLINGS] attacking the outer [GATE] , but one giant manages to make it through , greatly weakening the [GATE] by repeatedly smashing it with his fists and managing to singlehandedly begin lifting the [GATE] . [JON] , knowing the inner [GATE] won't [HOLD] against the massive giant , sends a group of [CASTLE BLACK] [BROTHERS] led by [GRENN] to [HOLD] it at any cost . arriving at the inner [GATE] , hill cowers when faced by the giant charging at them , but [GRENN] bolsters his and the others courage by reciting the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] oath . the [CASTLE BLACK] [BROTHERS] ready their weapons just as the giant slams himself into the inner [GATE] . 
. 
 [SAM] arrives atop the [WALL] to ask [JON] for more [MEN] to defend the [CASTLE BLACK] , and [JON] tasks [SAM] with releasing [GHOST] from his pen to assist in the fighting . [JON] descends the [WALL] and finally enters the fray , quickly dispatching several [WILDLINGS] and catching the attention of [STYR] the [TWO] meet in a single combat . [STYR] eventually gets the upper [HAND] by knocking [LONGCLAW] away and brutally assaulting [JON] , smashing his face into an anvil and tossing him into the blacksmith's forge . [STYR] picks [JON] up and begins strangling him , but [JON] spits [BLOOD] in [STYR] ['S] face and distracts him [LONG] enough for [JON] to grab the blacksmith's hammer lying next to him and buries it in [STYR] ['S] skull . 
 [JON] holds a dying [YGRITTE] . upon killing [STYR] , [JON] turns around to find [YGRITTE] pointing her bow at him with an arrow drawn . he smiles at her , causing [YGRITTE] to hesitate . before either can say anything , [YGRITTE] is shot near the heart by an arrow fired from [OLLY] , avenging the death of his father at [YGRITTE] ['S] hands during the wildling attack on his village . [JON] holds her in his arms as she tells him that they should have [NEVER] left the cave , and they lament circumstances that prevented them from being together as she succumbs to her wound . 
 [TORMUND] makes a last stand before he is subdued by [JON] and the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] . atop the [WALL] , [EDDISON] tollett , who [JON] left in command of the defenses , orders the [MEN] to drop the'scythe.' a huge section of [ICE] suddenly falls away from the [WALL] revealing a massive anchor like blade attached to a chain that swings along the [WALL] , mowing through the [WILDLINGS] attempting to [CLIMB] its face . [EDDISON] notices the wildling forces are beginning to withdraw into the haunted [FOREST] , proclaiming that they have stopped them for now , but that the [WILDLINGS] still outnumber the [CASTLE BLACK] [BROTHERS] 1 , 000 to 1 and that [MANCE] was simply testing their defenses . below , a heavily wounded [TORMUND] is surrounded in the courtyard but continues to fight despite being the only wildling alive in [CASTLE BLACK] . he is finally subdued by [JON] with a crossbow and taken prisoner by the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] for interrogation . [SAM] returns to [GILLY] just like he promised and discovers [JANOS SLYNT] , who hid in fear during the entire [BATTLE] . against all odds , the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] have repelled [MANCE RAYDER] ['S] forces for the time being . 
the following morning , what is left of [CASTLE BLACK] ['S] garrison begin to regroup and prepare for the inevitable next attack by [MANCE RAYDER] . [JON] discusses with [SAM] that he has a suicidal solution to [END] the wildling threat he plans to assassinate [MANCE RAYDER] , noting that he is the only thing binding the disparate wildling clans that make up the [ARMY] , and his death will rob them of that purpose and leadership . [SAM] tries to talk sense into [JON] , but to no avail . as [JON] prepares to leave via [CASTLE BLACK] ['S] tunnel , they discover the bodies of the [CASTLE BLACK] [BROTHERS] who held the inner [GATE] against the giant . [GRENN] is amongst the casualties and [JON] tells [SAM] that all bodies must be burned . before [JON] leaves , he [REMEMBERS] the promise he made to [JEOR MORMONT] and decides to leave [LONGCLAW] with [SAM] . [SAM] tells [JON] to [COME] back , and [JON] looks at [SAM] and smiles unreassuringly before stepping out into the wilderness on the other side of the [GATE] .

 [JON SNOW] emerges from the outer [GATE] of the [WALL] and begins trudging [NORTH] through the aftermath of the previous [KNIGHT] ['S] [BATTLE] towards [MANCE RAYDER] ['S] war camp . [JON SNOW] eventually reaches the tree line and is quickly surrounded by [WILDLINGS] , who bring him before [MANCE RAYDER] , who notes that he is wearing the [CASTLE BLACK] of the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] again . [MANCE RAYDER] brings [JON SNOW] inside his tent , and questions his status as a traitor . [JON SNOW] confesses that his time spent with the [WILDLINGS] was all part of a plan orchestrated by [QHORIN] [HALFHAND] to get [JON SNOW] to infiltrate [MANCE RAYDER] ['S] [ARMY] , and that [QHORIN] tricked [MANCE RAYDER] into trusting [JON SNOW] by allowing [JON SNOW] to [KILL] [QHORIN] himself in a fight . [MANCE RAYDER] asks about [YGRITTE] and [JON SNOW] reveals that she died at the [BATTLE] of [CASTLE BLACK] , though not by his hands . saddened , [MANCE RAYDER] proposes that they drink a toast to her memory , but [JON SNOW] is hesitant when given an unfamiliar drink . [JON SNOW] accepts after [MANCE RAYDER] assures him that if he'd wanted to [KILL] [JON SNOW] , poison would be the last of his methods . [MANCE RAYDER] then asks about the giant who got through the [GATE] but [NEVER] came out , and [JON SNOW] informs [MANCE RAYDER] that the giant perished attempting to breach the inner [GATE] at the hands of his friend [GRENN] . [MANCE RAYDER] ruefully notes that the giant was named [MAG] the mighty , and he was king of the giants , the last of a bloodline stretching back thousands of years before the [FIRST MEN] entered [WESTEROS] , to which [JON SNOW] then glibly notes that his friend [GRENN] was from a farm . they have another toast to [MAG] and [GRENN] . 
 [JON SNOW] then proposes his terms to [MANCE RAYDER] mance is to turn his [ARMY] around and return [HOME] . [MANCE RAYDER] immediately counters that the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] is low on oil , arrows , and [FIRST MEN] , and when he sent his full force against the [WALL] the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] threw everything they had at him to repel the attack . [MANCE RAYDER] guesses there are no more than 50 [FIRST MEN] left guarding [CASTLE BLACK] , but [JON SNOW] lies and insists that there are still over 1 , 000 [FIRST MEN] defending the garrison . however , [MANCE RAYDER] calls [JON SNOW] ['S] bluff and reveals that after seeing how few [FIRST MEN] were defending [CASTLE BLACK] , he sent 400 [FIRST MEN] about [FIVE] miles west to [CLIMB] an unmanned section of the [WALL] , and they will attack [CASTLE BLACK] ['S] weak southern side as soon as he gives the order . [MANCE RAYDER] then changes his demeanor and reveals that his people have suffered enough bloodshed and that he has no intention of conquering the [LANDS] [SOUTH] of the [WALL] that the [WILDLINGS] are moving [SOUTH] to seek refuge from the growing threat of the [WHITE WALKERS] just as those [SOUTH] of the [WALL] are . [MANCE RAYDER] then makes his counteroffer if the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] will open the gates to the [WILDLINGS] and allow them to pass through the [WALL] , no more harm will [COME] to the [CASTLE BLACK] [BROTHERS] . however , if his terms are refused , his wildling [ARMY] will slaughter every last member of the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] and move [SOUTH] by force . 
 [MANCE RAYDER] then notices that [JON SNOW] is eyeing a cooking knife , and quickly deduces that [JON SNOW] came to parley with [MANCE RAYDER] simply so he could assassinate him . he notes that at that moment his personal guards are far enough across the room that [JON SNOW] might actually be able to [KILL] him before being cut down himself , but that [JON SNOW] must have known he would [DIE] assassinating [MANCE RAYDER] . [MANCE RAYDER] is shocked and questions [JON SNOW] if this is what the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] has sunk to killing a [MAN] who let him into his own tent , accepting a parley in good [FAITH] , who shared food and drink with him , and who even offered him relatively reasonable peace terms . [JON SNOW] hesitates , but before anyone can make a move , war horns are heard from [OUTSIDE] . [MANCE RAYDER] ['S] guards safely grab [JON SNOW] during the distraction , and [MANCE RAYDER] demands to know if the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] is attacking them , but [JON SNOW] admits that it's just as [MANCE RAYDER] said the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] doesn't have remotely enough numbers to leave the safety of the [WALL] and attack . 
columns of heavy horse carrying hundreds of mounted cavalry charge into the wildling camp carrying the flaming stag [BANNERS] of [HOUSE BARATHEON] of [DRAGONSTONE] , and are led by none other than [STANNIS BARATHEON] and [DAVOS] seaworth . the [WILDLINGS] are caught in their own camp , resting from the [BATTLE] the [KNIGHT] before and only expecting attacks from the [WALL] , so their eastern flank is completely undefended . as they are undisciplined and have no experience fighting heavily armored cavalry , they are quickly dispatched by [STANNIS BARATHEON]' riders , who attack the wildling camp from both sides in [TWO] separate columns that catch the [WILDLINGS] in a perfect double envelopment . quickly cutting the wildling forces down , [STANNIS BARATHEON] and [DAVOS] ride up to [MANCE RAYDER] , who throws down his weapons in surrender , officially ending the [WILDLINGS]' [SIEGE] of [CASTLE BLACK] . 
 [DAVOS] introduces [STANNIS BARATHEON] as the true king of the [SEVEN KINGDOMS] , but [MANCE RAYDER] wryly points out that they are not currently in the [SEVEN KINGDOMS] . [STANNIS BARATHEON] demands that it is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king . resignedly , [MANCE RAYDER] says that the [FREE FOLK] do not kneel , knowing that [STANNIS BARATHEON] will [KILL] him if he does not . [DAVOS] , however , asks what a [MAN] of the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] is doing in the camp , and [JON SNOW] explains that he came to treaty with the king [BEYOND] the [WALL] . [JON SNOW] says that he knows that [STANNIS BARATHEON] is the true king , as his own father died supporting his claim , revealing himself as the bastard son of [EDDARD STARK] . this makes [STANNIS BARATHEON] regard [JON SNOW] more seriously . [STANNIS BARATHEON] proclaims that [EDDARD STARK] was an honorable [MAN] , and asks [JON SNOW] what [NED] would have done with [MANCE RAYDER] . [JON SNOW] responds that [MANCE RAYDER] could have killed him or tortured him when he was his captive but instead he spared his life , so instead of killing [MANCE RAYDER] he should be taken prisoner and interrogated . before they leave the wildling camp , [JON SNOW] also urges [STANNIS BARATHEON] to burn the [DEAD] before nightfall . . 
 [MELISANDRE] looks through the flames , and sees [JON SNOW] . 
back at [CASTLE BLACK] , a funeral is held for the slain members of the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] , who have been arranged in a huge funeral pyre in the [CASTLE BLACK] courtyard . maester [AEMON] delivers a eulogy , saying that they died to protect the [MEN] , women , and [CHILDREN] of the [SOUTH] who will [NEVER] even know who they were , that it is the duty of the surviving [CASTLE BLACK] [BROTHERS] to [KEEP] alive their memory . [AEMON] closes his speech with the customary line , and now their [WATCH] has [ENDED] , which is repeated by the gathered [MEN] . [SAMWELL] then aids [AEMON] in setting the pyre alight , which is continued by [JON SNOW] and other [MEN] carrying torches . [STANNIS BARATHEON] and [DAVOS] look on , along with queen [SELYSE] and princess [SHIREEN] . [JON SNOW] looks across the flames and catches the gaze of [MELISANDRE] , who is standing on the opposite side of the pyre . [MELISANDRE] seems intrigued , her piercing stare clearly making [JON SNOW] uneasy . 
afterwards , [JON SNOW] enters the chamber of the [CASTLE BLACK] where [TORMUND] is being held . [TORMUND] asks why blind [OLD] maester [AEMON] patched up his arrow wounds , and [JON SNOW] says that [AEMON] is sworn to heal all wounded [MEN] , friend or foe . [TORMUND] asks if [JON SNOW] really loved [YGRITTE] . [JON SNOW] doesn't respond . [TORMUND] says that [YGRITTE] truly loved him , and that he knew because although she [NEVER] admitted it , she talked only of killing him , revealing her true feelings for him if she hadn't loved him , she wouldn't have been so angered by his betrayal . saddened , [TORMUND] implores [JON SNOW] that [YGRITTE] ['S] final resting place should be in the real [NORTH] . [JON SNOW] then takes [YGRITTE] ['S] corpse to the [NORTH] side of the [WALL] and builds a funeral pyre for her near a sacred heart tree . [JON SNOW] looks at his lover one last time and lights her pyre , and weeps silently as he turns his back and heads [HOME] . 
far to the [NORTH] , [BRAN STARK] and the [REED] [CHILDREN] continue their journey to find the [THREE EYED RAVEN] , though they are on the brink of exhaustion . [JOJEN] [REED] has grown sick and and he is barely able to stand , eventually collapsing into the [JON SNOW] . as [MEERA] begs [JOJEN] to gather what little strength he can muster to continue forward , [BRAN STARK] calls out to them , revealing that they have found the massive heart tree that [BRAN STARK] has seen in his visions . as they approach the tree , wights burst up from the [JON SNOW] , grabbing [JOJEN] ['S] ankles and attempting to drag him under the [ICE] . these wights appear far older than those seen near the [WALL] , appearing as ghastly skeletal warriors who move with surprising agility . [MEERA] attempts to defend [JOJEN] from the wights , but they begin to swarm over [HODOR] , who is too scared to fight back . [BRAN STARK] wargs into [HODOR] ['S] mind and begins fighting off the wights with the aid of his direwolf [SUMMER] , but more wights [KEEP] bursting through the [ICE] and they are quickly overwhelmed . 
just as all seems lost , the wights around [BRAN STARK] suddenly burst into fireballs , and he hears a young girl's voice calling to him from a cave entrance at the base of the heart tree . amidst the confusion [JOJEN] is repeatedly stabbed by a wight before [MEERA] can fight it off . the mysterious girl calls to [MEERA] and says that [JOJEN] is lost and that she must leave him if she wants to live . [MEERA] hesitates , but [JOJEN] urges her to save herself . crying , [MEERA] slits her brother's throat to grant him the [MERCY] of a quick death . [MEERA] runs to the cave entrance along with [BRAN STARK] , [HODOR] , and [SUMMER] while the mysterious child covers their retreat by magically throwing fireballs from her hands at the wights . just as the life drains from [JOJEN] ['S] eyes , she launches a fireball at his body , immolating his corpse and preventing his return as a wight and fulfilling [JOJEN] ['S] vision that his death would involve [FIRE] . 
they run into the cave , pursued by the wights , who instantly shatter upon crossing the threshold of the cave . the little girl explains that the power which animates the [DEAD] corpses is powerless inside the cave . when [BRAN STARK] asks who she is , she replies that the [FIRST MEN] called us'the [CHILDREN] , but we were born [LONG] before them . [BRAN STARK] realizes that she is one of the last surviving members of the [CHILDREN] of the [FOREST] , the original , non human inhabitants of [WESTEROS] who carved the [FACES] into [WEIRWOOD] trees and taught the [FIRST MEN] to worship the [OLD GODS] thousands of years ago . 
the child leads them deeper into the cave , which is overgrown with [WHITE] [WEIRWOOD] roots from the massive tree above . other [CHILDREN] of the [FOREST] peek out around corners as they advance . finally , they arrive at a large central chamber , its floor littered with [BONES] . in the middle of the cave is an [OLD GODS] [MAN] seated in the middle of [WEIRWOOD] roots , which have grown around and even through much of his body . [HODOR] places [BRAN STARK] on the ground and [BRAN STARK] crawls towards the [OLD GODS] [MAN] , asking if he is the [THREE EYED RAVEN] who appeared in his visions . the [OLD GODS] [MAN] admits that he is , having taken several forms in the past , but his true form is before them now . [MEERA] is upset that her brother died to reach him , but the [THREE EYED RAVEN] says that [JOJEN] who possessed the greensight , as [BRAN STARK] does always knew that he would [DIE] helping [BRAN STARK] arrive here , but that he came nonetheless . he informs them that he has been watching all of them throughout their entire lives with a thousand eyes , and one . he continues by stating that [JOJEN] died so that [BRAN STARK] could [COME] here and regain what he has lost . [BRAN STARK] asks if he means he will regain the use of his legs . the [THREE EYED RAVEN] replies that [BRAN STARK] will [NEVER] [WALK] again , but you will fly . .

in [MEEREEN] , queen [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] sits in her [THRONE] room where she is receiving the day's supplicants . an [OLD GODS] [MAN] named [FENNESZ] approaches the [THRONE] , [FIRST MEN] speaking in [HIGH] [VALYRIAN] but then revealing that he also knows the common tongue . [FENNESZ] explains that he was not one of the slaves who toiled away at manual labor , but a well educated teacher and servant to master [MIGHDAL] , who employed him as a teacher for his own [CHILDREN] . he tells daenarys that master [MIGHDAL] ['S] [SEVEN] year [OLD GODS] daughter calla admires [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] , having learned of the [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] dynasty through [FENNESZ] ['S] teachings . 
as a servant of master [MIGHDAL] , [FENNESZ] was well treated and even well respected in the household , but when [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] forcibly freed all of the slaves in the [CITY] she did not understand the full scale complications of suddenly having to care for so many people . [FENNESZ] originally stayed in master [MIGHDAL] ['S] [HOUSE] after she took the [CITY] , and [MIGHDAL] ['S] [CHILDREN] begged him to stay , but [MIGHDAL] and [FENNESZ] agreed that he must leave rather than face reprisals , forcing [FENNESZ] to become homeless . [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] insists that she had established mess halls to feed the freed slaves and barracks to [HOUSE] them . fennez says that he has visited these refugee centers and they are not very safe the young prey on the [OLD GODS] , assaulting and robbing them . [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] insists that her [UNSULLIED] will restore order , but [FENNESZ] points out that even assuming that they are able to ensure his physical safety , he has lost his livelihood and his purpose and is too [OLD GODS] to start anew . therefore , he has [COME] to [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] to beg her permission to sell himself back to [MIGHDAL] . she is shocked that he would want to be owned as a slave again , as a [MAN] might own a goat or a chair . he implores her that the young [MAY] rejoice in her [NEW] world , but for those too [OLD GODS] to change , there is only fear and squalor . nor , he says , is he alone there are many supplicants waiting [OUTSIDE] lining up to make similar requests . 
 [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] is crestfallen , and says she did not liberate the slaves of [MEEREEN] only to preside over the very injustice she sought to destroy , but surprisingly relents and admits that freedom means making one's own choices . therefore she will allow [FENNESZ] to enter into a labor contract with [MIGHDAL] , but lasting no more than one year . he earnestly thanks her , and leaves . ser [BARRISTAN SELMY] warns [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] that the [MASTERS] will assuredly take advantage of this , quickly making contracts with all of the displaced former slaves until they are all slaves again in all but [NAME] . 
the next supplicant then enters , a shepherd carrying a bundle in his arms , similarly to the herdsman who came to show the [BONES] of their livestock which [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] ['S] [DRAGONS] burned in order to be reimbursed . the shepherd timidly approaches and states that he is unable to speak in the common tongue and requires [MISSANDEI] to translate . distraught , he tells daenarys that the winged [SHADOW] came , placing the bundle on the ground and opening it to reveal charred [BONES] of a human child . [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] ['S] largest dragon the [BLACK] one , [DROGON] has roasted the [MAN] ['S] [THREE EYED RAVEN] year [OLD GODS] daughter zalla until this is all that was left of her . horrified , [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] meets with [MISSANDEI] and [GREY WORM] in private to discuss how to deal with the growing threat the [DRAGONS] are posing to the people of [MEEREEN] . [GREY WORM] reports that [DROGON] was last seen flying over the [BLACK] cliffs [THREE EYED RAVEN] days ago , but he can no longer be found . realizing that she can no longer control her [DRAGONS] , [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] tells them to head with her to the catacombs under the [CITY] . later , she leads her remaining [TWO] [DRAGONS] , [RHAEGAL] and viserion , into the catacombs , where they are distracted by sheep carcasses . as they are feeding , [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] personally locks huge [IRON] collars around their necks , which are secured by heavy [CHAINS] . she weeps as she does so , as it is symbolically reducing her remaining [CHILDREN] to chained up slaves themselves . [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] wordlessly leaves and closes the huge [STONE] [DOOR] to the catacombs behind her as her [DRAGONS] grow distressed and pathetically call after her when they attempt to follow and realize they are chained in place .

in [GRAND] maester [PYCELLE] ['S] laboratory in king's [LANDING] , [CERSEI] , [PYCELLE] , and [QYBURN] stand over ser [GREGOR CLEGANE] , who lies immobilized on a flat wooden table and is revealed to be suffering from a massive wound centered around his right side . [PYCELLE] informs [CERSEI] that [OBERYN] [MARTELL] had coated his spear with manticore venom , poisoning ser [GREGOR CLEGANE] . the effects are horrific , with [GREGOR CLEGANE] ['S] wounds putrefying and creating a terrible stench . [PYCELLE] says that he is [BEYOND] any hope of recovery , but [QYBURN] insists to [CERSEI] that he can save him using more unorthodox methods . [PYCELLE] chaffes at his suggestion , stating that he is not even a maester , and that such arrogance is what led to [QYBURN] ['S] expulsion from the [CITADEL] in the [FIRST] place , for experiments that were deemed both dangerous and unnatural . [CERSEI] , determined to save [GREGOR CLEGANE] from death , dismisses [PYCELLE] and orders [QYBURN] to do whatever is necessary , infuriating [PYCELLE] , who angrily shuffles out of the laboratory . she asks [QYBURN] if his treatment will work , and [QYBURN] claims that if his past work is any indicator , he stands a chance at saving [GREGOR CLEGANE] . [QYBURN] states that the process will change him , although [CERSEI] seems only concerned with whether it will weaken him , to which [QYBURN] replies oh no . [CERSEI] leaves , and [QYBURN] begins syphoning out [GREGOR CLEGANE] ['S] tainted [BLOOD] . 
 [CERSEI] approaches [TYWIN] and insists that she will not submit to a forced marriage to ser [LORAS] [TYRELL] . he attempts to dismiss the subject by stating that the matter is closed , but she persists and says that it is not just because she does not love [LORAS] he wants to ship her off to [HIGHGARDEN] and remove her from the court entirely , keeping her away from her last remaining son . with [CERSEI] out of the picture , both [MARGAERY] and [TYWIN] will attempt to get their claws into [TOMMEN] , each trying to manipulate him into their allegiance . [TYWIN] refuses to budge , so [CERSEI] plays her trump card she threatens to destroy [HOUSE LANNISTER] by telling everyone the truth . [TYWIN] seems confused , and at [FIRST] [CERSEI] scoffs that he is merely feigning ignorance . with growing realization , she assesses that even the brilliant [TYWIN LANNISTER] [NEVER] noticed what was going on between his own [CHILDREN] , when all it would have taken was one attentive moment in the past twenty years . [TYWIN LANNISTER] is still apparently confused , so with a merciless grin [CERSEI] reveals that all of the rumors about her and [JAIME] and their [CHILDREN] are true she will tell everyone and destroy [TYWIN LANNISTER] ['S] vaunted family legacy , even though it will also mean her death and [TOMMEN] ['S] death . [TYWIN LANNISTER] shakes with barely constrained rage , but in denial he accuses that [CERSEI] is simply lying to anger him . [CERSEI] says she doubts he truly thinks that and leaves him standing in his chamber alone . 
 [CERSEI] finds [JAIME] in the [WHITE] sword [TOWER] , and he expresses disgust at her blatant attempts to have [TYRION] killed . [CERSEI] asserts that [TYRION] killed their [MOTHER] when she gave birth to him . [JAIME] is surprised that she still irrationally blames him for that , pointing out that he was an infant and had no control over what happened . he insists that [TYRION] is her family , whether she chooses to accept it or not . she rebukes his claim , saying he is not her family and that they all have a choice , and that she chooses [JAIME] . she then reveals that she has spilled their secret to [TYWIN LANNISTER] . he is stunned and concerned by her actions , asking how [TYWIN LANNISTER] reacted to the news , but she states that she does not want to discuss their father . she begins to seduce him , saying she chooses her brother over everyone else in the world , no longer concerned with whether anyone else knows their secret . he yields to her advances , kissing her passionately and throwing her on the table where they begin to have sex . 
in the middle of the [NIGHT] , [TYRION] is awoken in his cell by the sound of his cell [DOOR] being opened by [JAIME] , who reveals that he has orchestrated an escape plan for [TYRION] with the assistance of [VARYS] , who has secured a galley in the harbor on which [TYRION] can sneak out of the [CITY] and flee to the [FREE CITIES] . he leads [TYRION] to a stairway leading up to a locked [DOOR] , instructing [TYRION] to knock on it twice and then twice more to summon [VARYS] , who will lead him to the ship . before they part ways , [TYRION] and [JAIME] share a tender embrace and say their goodbyes , unsure if either will ever see the other again . 
 [TYRION] , alone , stares at the [DOOR] at the top of the staircase , ultimately deciding to use the secret passages of the [RED KEEP] to infiltrate the [TOWER] of the [HAND] . he enters the [HAND] of the king's quarters , and sees a [WOMAN] lying in [TYWIN LANNISTER] ['S] bed , with [TYWIN LANNISTER] ['S] clothes folded up on a chair . as he draws closer he sees that the [WOMAN] is [SHAE] , who thinks it is [TYWIN LANNISTER] and calls out for him , calling him my [LION] as she had once done to [TYRION] . when she turns over and sees that it is [TYRION] , looking utterly betrayed , she grabs a knife to defend herself . [TYRION] could retreat but instead he rushes forward onto the bed to wrestle it from her grasp . [TYRION] manages to knock the knife from her hands and the [TWO] continue to struggle violently until [TYRION] manages to grab the necklace around her throat which he once gave her as a [GIFT] and strangles her with it . he continues to strangle her [LONG] after she has stopped resisting , until she is [DEAD] . he sinks to the floor and sits next to [SHAE] ['S] lifeless body , weeping , and tells her he's sorry . he stares at the [WALL] across the room and sees several weapons on display , among them [JOFFREY] ['S] [OLD] crossbow , and his expression quickly darkens . 
 [TYRION] takes the crossbow down from the [WALL] , loads it , and heads down the [HALL] to the privy , opening the [DOOR] to find his father seated upon the toilet . [TYWIN LANNISTER] seems surprised to see [TYRION] , but quickly regains composure and asks [TYRION] to lower the crossbow . he correctly deduces that [JAIME] helped [TYRION] escape his cell , telling [TYRION] that they can discuss the matter back in [TYWIN LANNISTER] ['S] chambers . however , when he attempts to stand , [TYRION] steadies the crossbow , stopping him [DEAD] in his tracks . all my life you've wanted me [DEAD] , [TYRION] states , and [TYWIN LANNISTER] acknowledges the validity of his claim . he attempts to defuse the situation by telling [TYRION] that despite this , [TYRION] has stubbornly clung to life , which [TYWIN LANNISTER] states he finds admirable and insists that he was [NEVER] going to have [TYRION] actually killed . [TYRION] admits that he just murdered [SHAE] with his bare hands , but [TYWIN LANNISTER] scoffs that it doesn't matter as she was nothing more than a whore . [TYRION] is angered by [TYWIN LANNISTER] ['S] indifference and raises the crossbow , threatening that if his father says the word whore one more time he will [KILL] him . [TYWIN LANNISTER] balks that [TYRION] won't [KILL] his own father in the privy , and again tries to convince [TYRION] that they should continue to discuss this in his chambers . [TYRION] says he can not go back to [TYWIN LANNISTER] ['S] chambers because [SHAE] ['S] body is still there . [TYWIN LANNISTER] dares [TYRION] by calling his bluff and mocking him by saying because you're afraid of a [DEAD] whore . 
 [TYRION] was not bluffing . the moment [TYWIN LANNISTER] utters the word whore again , [TYRION] looses his crossbow bolt , hitting [TYWIN LANNISTER] in the belly and knocking him backwards . [TYWIN LANNISTER] is incredulous that [TYRION] actually had the courage to fight back against him , and that he will [DIE] in such an undignified way at the hands of his hated dwarf son . as [TYRION] reloads the crossbow , [TYWIN LANNISTER] angrily declares that [TYRION] is no son of his . i am your son , [TYRION] replies quietly , i have always been your son , and fires a [SECOND] bolt into [TYWIN LANNISTER] ['S] heart , killing him . [TYRION] discards the crossbow as he leaves to find [VARYS] , who immediately realizes [TYRION] has done something terrible , exclaiming what have you done nonetheless , he leads [TYRION] out of the [CASTLE] to the docks where [TYRION] is stowed away inconspicuously in a crate aboard the ship . [VARYS] begins walking back towards the [RED KEEP] but stops when he hears the bells begin to toll , signaling the discovery of [TYWIN LANNISTER] ['S] body . realizing that returning to the [CASTLE] is likely unsafe , [VARYS] turns around and heads back for the ship , sitting next to [TYRION] ['S] crate in silence as they cast off for essos . 
in the [VALE] , [BRIENNE] of [TARTH] and [PODRICK] [PAYNE] are heading towards the bloody [GATE] when they happen upon [ARYA STARK] practicing her [WATER] dancing while [SANDOR CLEGANE] is off relieving himself , both returning from the [EYRIE] after receiving [WORDS] of [LYSA ARRYN] ['S] death . [BRIENNE] and [ARYA STARK] converse for a moment , both showing respect for one another as they are both women who have fought against what has been expected of them their entire lives . they are interrupted by the return of the [HOUND] , who is immediately recognized by [PODRICK] , causing [BRIENNE] to realize that the girl is [ARYA STARK] . [BRIENNE] tells [ARYA STARK] of her sacred vow to protect her [MOTHER] , although she failed to do so because she was sent by her [MOTHER] to return [JAIME LANNISTER] . the [HOUND] immediately accuses [BRIENNE] of working for the [LANNISTERS] , noticing her [VALYRIAN] steel sword [OATHKEEPER] , which [BRIENNE] admits was given to her by [JAIME LANNISTER] , frightening [ARYA STARK] into thinking that [BRIENNE] is working for the [LANNISTERS] . [BRIENNE] implores [ARYA STARK] to [COME] with her to safety , causing the [HOUND] to mock [BRIENNE] , pointing out that there is no safety for [ARYA STARK] anymore her aunt [LYSA ARRYN] in the [EYRIE] whom [BRIENNE] and [PODRICK] are seeking out is [DEAD] , as are her father , [MOTHER] , and older brother , while the [ARYA STARK] armies are scattered and [WINTERFELL] is a smoking ruin . they draw [SWORDS] and begin fighting , both eventually disarming each other and resorting to brutally fighting each other in [HAND] to [HAND] combat . ultimately , [BRIENNE] gains the upper [HAND] by biting off a chunk of [SANDOR CLEGANE] ['S] ear and knocks him down a cliff side . [BRIENNE] goes to search for [ARYA STARK] , who slipped away during the melee and has hidden herself amongst the [ROCK] formations . as [BRIENNE] and [PODRICK] search the surrounding area for [ARYA STARK] in vain , [ARYA STARK] makes her way down the cliff side to find the [HOUND] badly wounded . he tells her that unless there is a maester miraculously on [HAND] to tend to his wounds , he's finished . [SANDOR CLEGANE] tells her to [KILL] him and scratch another [NAME] off her list , but she just sits and stares at him silently . he grows angry and begins recounting running down the butcher's [BOY] and how he should have raped [SANSA] in king's [LANDING] in an attempt to goad [ARYA STARK] into killing him in anger , but she remains [SILENT] . [SANDOR CLEGANE] finally begs her to [KILL] him and put him out of his misery , but she quietly refuses and takes his money purse , leaving him screaming at her to [KILL] him as she silently walks away . 
 [ARYA STARK] rides a horse to the nearby coast of the [VALE] , where she sees a wharf with ships docked . she approaches a captain and asks if she can pay for travel to the [NORTH] , but he says that they won't go there because these days the [NORTH] is full of war , cold , and pirates . instead , the ship is going [HOME] to the [FREE] [CITY] of [BRAAVOS] . [ARYA STARK] [REMEMBERS] the special coin that the [FACELESS] [MAN] known as [JAQEN H] ['GHAR] gave her , and instructed her to present to any [MAN] from [BRAAVOS] if she needed aid . she does so now , and the captain is utterly surprised at how she obtained it , but she says only [VALAR MORGHULIS] as [JAQEN H] instructed , to which the captain gives the traditional response , [VALAR DOHAERIS] . he warmly welcomes her aboard the ship , and insists that she will have her own cabin . as the ship casts off , [ARYA STARK] stands aboard the ship and watches as the shore of [WESTEROS] shrinks further and further away . she then moves to the prow of the ship , looking forward across the [NARROW SEA] in the direction of the [FREE CITIES] and [BRAAVOS] .

[TYRION LANNISTER] remains despondent , and as he promised , he is continuing to drink himself into a stupor . [VARYS] explains that they are travelling to [MEEREEN] by way of [VOLANTIS] . [VARYS] points out that [TYRION LANNISTER] was an effective ruler when he was acting [HAND] of the king , and that each of them were outsiders due to their deformities a eunuch and a dwarf . they enjoyed accumulating power , he says , but they also [WALL] themselves off from other people , like hiding inside of a large carriage as they are now but deep down they were [NEVER] satisfied being separate from society .

in king's [LANDING] , [CERSEI LANNISTER] is presented with the severed head of yet another dwarf . her offer of a lordship for [TYRION LANNISTER] ['S] head has indeed motivated people to start killing any dwarf they can find and try to pass it off as [TYRION LANNISTER] . [CERSEI LANNISTER] is irate , but won't punish the [MEN] who brought her the head for fear this will deter other such bounty hunters . she wants the head disposed of , but [QYBURN] interjects and politely asks if he can [KEEP] the head , as it might be of use in some of his experiments . .

[CERSEI LANNISTER] lashes out at [JAIME] for not being a father to any of his [CHILDREN] , to which he points out that if he had been , their [CHILDREN] would be stoned in the streets . he declares he will fix the situation with myrcella and ignores [CERSEI LANNISTER] ['S] mocking of his one handed status . 
that issue dealt with , [CERSEI LANNISTER] convenes the [SMALL COUNCIL] . sitting in the [HAND] ['S] seat , she announces that [TOMMEN] has declared [QYBURN] the [NEW] master of whisperers and that the position of [HAND] of the king will remain vacant until [TOMMEN] is [OLD] enough to decide on a candidate for himself . [TOMMEN] has apparently also decided to make [MACE] [TYRELL] the [NEW] master of coin in addition to his duties as master of ships , and extends the just now made up position of master of war to [KEVAN] [CERSEI LANNISTER] . although [MACE] preens at his [NEW] responsibilities , [PYCELLE] is outraged at [QYBURN] ['S] promotion as he was thrown out of the order of maesters for conducting human experimentation . [KEVAN] is disgusted at [CERSEI LANNISTER] ['S] blatant power play . refusing the [NEW] position , he denounces [CERSEI LANNISTER] as nothing more than the queen [MOTHER] , berates her for abusing her authority to fill the [SMALL COUNCIL] with her sycophants . he then walks out , saying he will await king [TOMMEN] ['S] own instructions at [CASTERLY ROCK] . 
further [NORTH] in the [CROWNLANDS] at [CASTLE] stokeworth , bronn is spending time with his somewhat vapid betrothed [LOLLYS] stokeworth . they seem to get on relatively well , but when [LOLLYS] reminds bronn that her older sister will get the [CASTLE] when their [MOTHER] dies , he wryly assures her that mean people like her sister usually get what's [COMING] to them , clearly setting his sights on the [CASTLE] . [JAIME] finds the couple , and reveals to bronn that [CERSEI LANNISTER] has reneged on her deal and offered [LOLLYS] ['S] [HAND] to ser willas bracken instead . bronn is understandably furious about the change of arrangements until [JAIME] tells him that if he helps rescue myrcella from [DORNE] , bronn will receive a much better girl than [LOLLYS] , who has rights to a much better [CASTLE] .

[MACE] is oblivious that this is also [CERSEI] ['S] way of removing him from the capital , and takes it as a [HIGH SPARROW] [HONOR] as well as that [CERSEI] will send ser [MERYN TRANT] of the [KINGSGUARD] along to guard him . after he leaves , [PYCELLE] bitterly points out that the [SMALL COUNCIL] is growing even smaller the only [THREE] members left in the capital are [PYCELLE] , [CERSEI] , and her lackey [QYBURN] , but she says it hasn't quite grown [SMALL COUNCIL] enough yet . 
 [CERSEI] meets with the [HIGH SPARROW] . 
 [CERSEI] then meets with the [HIGH SPARROW] , who by her influence , has been elected as the [NEW] [HIGH SEPTON] of the [FAITH] of the [SEVEN] . [CERSEI] is trying to build up a [NEW] alliance between the [CROWN] and the [FAITH] , as a counterweight against the large political influence the [TYRELLS] now possess . [CERSEI] points out to the [HIGH SPARROW] that the war of the [FIVE KINGS] has devastated much of the countryside , resulting in septs being burned , clergymen attacked , and even [SILENT SISTERS] raped . bodies of holy [MEN] are piling up in the streets . the [HIGH SPARROW] admits that [WARS] make [MEN] obey the sword more than the [GODS] . [CERSEI] points out that before the [TARGARYENS] , the military order known as the [FAITH MILITANT] dispensed the justice of the [SEVEN] . the [HIGH SEPTON] is confused , as the [TARGARYENS] disbanded the [FAITH MILITANT] over [TWO] centuries ago . [CERSEI] explains that , as part of the [NEW] alliance she hopes to build between the [CROWN] and the [FAITH MILITANT] , she will tell her son to repeal the law and allow the [FAITH MILITANT] to be reestablished and re armed an [ARMY] whose purpose is to defend the [FAITH MILITANT] , holy [MEN] , and the smallfolk and which will incidentally be turned against the [CROWN] ['S] enemies . she then advises him that there is a [GREAT] sinner in their midst who has been shielded by gold and power . the [HIGH SPARROW] replies with a wish for the father to judge him justly . 
the [NEW] [FAITH MILITANT] [STORM] the streets of king's [LANDING] , attacking taverns , brothels , and street vendors selling idols from other religions . the [CITY WATCH] look on , helpless , and do not intervene . they ransack [LITTLEFINGER] ['S] brothel , dragging prostitutes like marei out into the street by their hair . [OLYVAR] is struck and ignored as they barge in he then sees that in another room they have singled out a [MAN] having sex with one of the male prostitutes , and approach him with a knife . [OLYVAR] flees . 
 [TOMMEN] attempts to have his brother in law [LORAS] released , but fails . 
as a sign of their zealotry , the [FAITH MILITANT] have the [SEVEN] pointed star symbol of the [FAITH MILITANT] carved into their foreheads including [LANCEL] , who leads a squad of the [FAITH MILITANT] to apprehend [LORAS] [HOUSE TYRELL] while he is sparring in the practice yard . [LANCEL] proclaims that [LORAS]' sexual perversions are sins against the [LAWS] of [GODS] and [TOMMEN] , and [LORAS] is dragged off . [MARGAERY TYRELL] is furious at [TOMMEN] for her brother's arrest , then tries to manipulate him by weeping at how hurt she is that he let this happen to [LORAS] . [TOMMEN] then goes to his [MOTHER] and , briefly standing up to her , demands that [LORAS] be released at once . [CERSEI] calmly points out that she didn't arrest [LORAS] , the [FAITH MILITANT] simply dragged him off and imprisoned him , so he should ask the [HIGH SPARROW] to release him . [TOMMEN] naively thinks the [HIGH SPARROW] will simply do as he requests , so he heads to the [GREAT SEPT] of [BAELOR] with [FIVE KINGS] [KINGSGUARD] and several [LANNISTER] guards . the path to the [GREAT SEPT] is blocked by the [FAITH MILITANT] , who say that the [HIGH SPARROW] is praying and does not wish to be disturbed . the [KINGSGUARD] request that [TOMMEN] let them [KILL] the [FAITH MILITANT] to pass . [TOMMEN] is surprised at this and does not want to risk bloodshed escalating matters particularly , shedding [BLOOD] on holy ground . unsure of what to do , the mob of commoners behind him starts shouting that he is really a bastard and an abomination of incest . realizing this is not going to [END] well , [TOMMEN] meekly withdraws back to the [RED KEEP] . [MARGAERY TYRELL] is even more upset at how ineffectual young [TOMMEN] was , so she leaves saying that she is going to bring her grandmother [OLENNA] back to the capital to deal with this .

 [JAIME LANNISTER] and ser bronn are on a [PENTOSHI] merchant ship , which is headed to [OLDTOWN] in the reach . they sail past [TARTH] , off the coast of the [STORMLANDS] , which [JAIME LANNISTER] mistakenly identifies as estermont . the captain corrects him , stating that they are sailing through the sapphire isle , which reminds him of [BRIENNE] . [JAIME LANNISTER] explains to bronn that he bribed the captain to let them take a [SMALL] boat to shore as they pass [DORNE] , and they will land just [OUTSIDE] of [SUNSPEAR] and the adjacent [WATER GARDENS] . below decks , bronn remarks on why [JAIME LANNISTER] must want to go and protect princess myrcella for himself he's the one who let [TYRION] escape , and he hopes this will make up for that . [JAIME LANNISTER] curtly says that [VARYS] did when in fact , [JAIME LANNISTER] forced [VARYS] to help him [FREE] [TYRION] . bronn says that if [JAIME LANNISTER] ever sees [TYRION] again [JAIME LANNISTER] should give him his regards [JAIME LANNISTER] angrily says that if he sees his brother again , he's going to split him in [TWO] for murdering their father [TYWIN] . 
 [JAIME LANNISTER] uses his metal [HAND] to stop a blade . 
bronn rows the pair ashore at dusk , though [JAIME LANNISTER] can't help row with his one [HAND] . when they awake the next morning bronn kills a snake that was near [JAIME LANNISTER] ['S] head and roasts it up for breakfast . bronn is worried that the ship's captain will subsequently spread word that a [JAIME LANNISTER] is in [DORNE] [JAIME LANNISTER] says he bribed him with a large bag of gold , but bronn still worries . a mounted patrol soon comes by , however , and sees their tracks in the [SAND] . [JAIME LANNISTER] and bronn present themselves and try to pass off that they are simple travelers and their boat capsized in the [NIGHT] , but the ruse doesn't work , and the sentries demand that they drop their weapons so they can be taken prisoner and their identities confirmed . bronn plants his sword in the [SAND] then quickly throws his dagger in the lead sentry's throat . [JAIME LANNISTER] and bronn draw their [SWORDS] and fight the rest . [JAIME LANNISTER] can't fight very well left handed so bronn kills one sentry's horse in order for [JAIME LANNISTER] to fight him on foot . [JAIME LANNISTER] is being overpowered but catches the sentry's sword with his metal [HAND] at the last moment . he then uses the distraction to land a killing blow to the sentry with his left [HAND] . bronn , having finished off the other sentries , notes that they now have their horses fine [DORNISH] [SAND] steeds , capable of running a day and a [NIGHT] [WITHOUT] tiring . [JAIME LANNISTER] says the bodies need to be buried so they won't raise more questions . bronn says it will take a lot of time to dig holes for them all , though [JAIME LANNISTER] again points out that he can't really do much digging with one [HAND] . annoyed , bronn then drags off the bodies to bury . 
the [SAND SNAKES] torture a merchant ship captain . 
meanwhile , elsewhere [OUTSIDE] of [SUNSPEAR] , [ELLARIA SAND] meets with [THREE] of the eight [SAND SNAKES] , her lover [OBERYN] [MARTELL] ['S] bastard daughters .

 [OBARA] then points out that they [MAY] have a problem . the [PENTOSHI] ship captain found her in planky [OLDTOWN] , and as bronn feared , he indeed tried to sell her information about [JAIME LANNISTER] ['S] arrival in [DORNE] . the [SAND SNAKES] , however , were insulted that he wanted to be paid for such vital information instead of offering it freely , so they took him prisoner and tortured it out of him . [NYMERIA] uses her whip to knock a bucket over , and reveals underneath that they buried the ship's captain [NECK] deep in the [SAND SNAKES] , with his head under a bucket full of poisonous scorpions . they realize that they are now in a race against time to see who can take myrcella from [DORAN] [FIRST] [JAIME LANNISTER] or themselves . [ELLARIA SAND] asks if the [THREE] girls are with her , knowing this will bring [DORNE] into war . [NYMERIA] and [TYENE] say yes . [OBARA] notes that when she [FIRST] met [OBERYN] , he was a [MAN] whom she had [NEVER] met who one day appeared , said he was her father , and that he was taking her away from her [MOTHER] . her [MOTHER] wept , but [OBERYN] said that , we all must choose our battles and the [GODS] let us choose our weapons . he threw his spear at her feet , pointed to her [MOTHER] ['S] tears , then to his spear , and told her to choose . she chose the spear and answers [ELLARIA SAND] that she is with her , as she chose the path of the spear and war [LONG] ago . she then throws her spear to impale the ship captain's head .

 [JON SNOW] trains recruits in the practice yard of [CASTLE BLACK] , as [STANNIS BARATHEON] and his wife [SELYSE] [WATCH] , along with their daughter [SHIREEN] . [SELYSE] is worried that [STANNIS BARATHEON] wishes [JON SNOW] was his son , because she gave him only stillbirths and weakness , but he says that wasn't her fault . [MELISANDRE] joins them and appears to quite firmly take [STANNIS BARATHEON] ['S] side , declaring that the lord of [LIGHT] doesn't care about [SHIREEN] ['S] greyscale disfigurement , and this doesn't change the fact that she has her father's [BLOOD] . when [SELYSE] departs , [MELISANDRE] discusses the [COMING] [BATTLE] to take [WINTERFELL] from the [BOLTONS] . she asks if [STANNIS BARATHEON] intends to leave her behind as he did at the [BLACKWATER] , but [STANNIS BARATHEON] assures her he won't this time . 
as the [NEW] lord commander , [JON SNOW] goes over paperwork with [SAMWELL TARLY] , letters they have received from minor [HOUSES] offering up a handful of [NEW] recruits . [JON SNOW] balks when [SAMWELL TARLY] hands him a request letter for [ROOSE BOLTON] , saying he killed his brother [ROBB] .

[PETYR] [BAELISH] arrives and says he thought he'd find her there . [SANSA STARK] remarks that her father , [EDDARD STARK] , [NEVER] talked about [LYANNA STARK] , but she would at times find him down in the crypts lighting candles at her tomb . [SANSA STARK] [NEVER] knew [LYANNA STARK] because she died before she was born , but she notes that people say she was beautiful . 
 [LITTLEFINGER] says that he actually saw [LYANNA STARK] once years ago , and she was as beautiful as everyone says . back when he was a [BOY] living with [SANSA STARK] ['S] [MOTHER] ['S] family , the [OLD] lord whent of [HARRENHAL] held a massive tournament every notable figure of the time came from across [WESTEROS] the [MAD] king , [CROWN] [PRINCE] [RHAEGAR TARGARYEN] , [ROBERT BARATHEON] , [LYANNA STARK] , everyone .

[BAELISH] gives her a wry look and moves on to another part of the crypts . 
 [SANSA STARK] notices that [LITTLEFINGER] is wearing riding clothes , and he explains that he is heading back to king's [LANDING] , because [CERSEI] sent a letter requesting his presence and it would be best not to make her suspicious by refusing to [COME] . [SANSA STARK] will be alone with the [BOLTONS] but he explains his plan to her [STANNIS BARATHEON] will have to attack the [BOLTONS] soon if he is to beat the [WINTER] snows , and he bets that [STANNIS BARATHEON] will probably [WIN] , because he is one of the best military commanders in all of [WESTEROS] , and the [BOLTONS] will be outnumbered by [STANNIS BARATHEON] , as the other [NORTHERN] [HOUSES] would be quick to betray their liege lord .

 [DANY] speaks with ser [BARRISTAN SELMY] . 
in [MEEREEN] , [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] is looking down on the streets below from her royal apartments in the [GREAT] pyramid , and ser [BARRISTAN SELMY] also brings up [RHAEGAR TARGARYEN] . he says that the [CITY] ['S] inhabitants always seem happy from such a distance , but [RHAEGAR TARGARYEN] actually liked to leave the [RED KEEP] and mingle with the common people on the streets . [BARRISTAN SELMY] accompanied him often to guard him , and says that [RHAEGAR TARGARYEN] liked to sing to people . he was a [GREAT] singer , so he would find a place on one of the streets just like any public minstrel and sing . he liked to see how much money he could make , and everyone enjoyed his singing , so he often made quite a lot . [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] is surprised , because her brother [VISERYS] only told her that [RHAEGAR TARGARYEN] was a [GREAT] killer . . 
an injured [GREY WORM] continues to fight the [SONS] of the [HARPY] . 
 [BARRISTAN SELMY] scoffs that [RHAEGAR TARGARYEN] was a [GREAT] warrior but [NEVER] enjoyed killing , he was a gentle [MAN] who enjoyed singing . she asks what they did with all the money , and [BARRISTAN SELMY] says that they did all sorts of [THINGS] sometimes they just gave it to the next minstrel on the road , once [RHAEGAR TARGARYEN] gave it all to an orphanage in the slums of [FLEA BOTTOM] , and one time they spent it to get horribly drunk . [DAARIO] [NAHARIS] then comes to say that the day's supplicants are waiting in the [THRONE] room , chief among them [HIZDAHR] zo [LORAQ] . aware of his dislike of politics , [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] asks if [BARRISTAN SELMY] wants to attend her in the [THRONE] room after being assured that [DAARIO] has her back , she gives him the day off , cheerfully telling him to make some music in the [CITY] below . 
 [HIZDAHR] again beseeches [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] to reopen the fighting pits of [MEEREEN] , because today is the traditional beginning of the fighting [SEASON] . [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] again refuses , but [HIZDAHR] rationally argues that the fighting pits provide a [GREAT] spectacle that has always been enjoyed by both the slave [MASTERS] and slaves , and is one of the few [THINGS] that can bring the [CITY] together . bringing back this major tradition will not instantly solve all of her problems , he concedes , but it would be a start at mending together her subjects . 
 [BARRISTAN SELMY] runs towards danger . 
as he speaks , the [SONS] of the [HARPY] are already mounting a series of large scale attacks in the streets . a meereenese prostitute helps them distract and [KILL] some of the [SECOND SONS] , and when a patrol of [UNSULLIED] arrives , she feigns fear and directs them into a trap by pointing that the [SECOND SONS] of the [HARPY] ran into a [NARROW] alleyway . the [UNSULLIED] give chase , only to be surrounded by a much larger number of the [SECOND SONS] of the [HARPY] . brutal fighting rages throughout the streets of [MEEREEN] . [GREY WORM] is among the ambushed [UNSULLIED] he kills many attackers , though he loses his helmet , is slashed in the leg , and is stabbed in his side . [GREY WORM] pulls the dagger out of himself , stabs a foe in the throat with it , and keeps fighting , though his wounds slow him considerably . most of the [SECOND SONS] of the [HARPY] are [DEAD] but they outnumber the [UNSULLIED] so much to begin with that only [GREY WORM] is left . just then , ser [BARRISTAN SELMY] arrives and saves [GREY WORM] by drawing the attention of the remaining rebels . he takes on eight [SECOND SONS] of the [HARPY] and defeats them all , save for the last one , who stabs him in the belly . he falls to his knees and just as his attacker is about to slit his throat , [GREY WORM] takes him out by shoving his spear into his back . [GREY WORM] staggers over [BARRISTAN SELMY] , but he has lost consciousness . severely wounded , [GREY WORM] then slumps down to the floor next to him .

[DAENERYS TARGARYEN] and [DAARIO] [NAHARIS] wake over the deceased ser [BARRISTAN SELMY] . [HIZDAHR] zo [LORAQ] enters to extend his condolences . [DAARIO] suggests pulling back around the pyramid to use it as a base from which to eradicate the [SECOND SONS] of the [HARPY] .

[MISSANDEI] says that everyone fears death . however , [GREY WORM] says it isn't death he fears , it is the thought of [NEVER] getting to see [MISSANDEI] again that terrified him . [MISSANDEI] is noticeably touched and kisses [GREY WORM] . 
 [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] asks [MISSANDEI] whether she should reopen the fighting pits . [MISSANDEI] only says that she has seen [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] listening to her counselors when her own experience was lacking and ignoring them when she thought they were wrong . [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] visits the imprisoned [HIZDAHR] , who begs for his life . [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] tells him she has decided to reopen the fighting pits , but only for [FREE] [MEN] . she also says that she will marry the head of an ancient family of [MEEREEN] to forge a bond with the people of the [CITY] , and that she luckily has one of them on his knees already . she leaves a very confused [HIZDAHR] to ponder that he will live , and that he will soon be [MEEREEN] ['S] [PRINCE] consort .

[TYRION LANNISTER] is annoyed that they didn't find any villages to steal a boat or supplies from as [JORAH MORMONT] had hoped , so they're slowly walking and only have berries and roots to eat . the topic of just why [TYRION LANNISTER] was even in [VOLANTIS] comes up , and [TYRION LANNISTER] is surprised that [JORAH MORMONT] did not ask earlier he explains that he actually fled from [WESTEROS] because he killed his own father [TYWIN] . he says he did it because his father tried to have him executed for a crime he didn't commit , and then he found his father screwing the [WOMAN] he loved [JORAH MORMONT] nods , as this seems as likely a motivation for kinslaying as any .

[TYRION LANNISTER] remains skeptical that this doesn't automatically mean she will be a good queen , given that the [TARGARYENS] were famous for going insane , just like [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] ['S] own father .

 [SANSA] reminds him of the unborn baby , who , if a [BOY] , will have a stronger claim on the [NORTH] since he'll be a true born . [RAMSAY] tells her that he is [ROOSE BOLTON] ['S] eldest son , legitimized by the king , who [SANSA] reminds him is another bastard . [RAMSAY] is obviously angered by [SANSA] ['S] remarks , but doesn't act on it , simply stating that [BASTARDS] can rise in the world too , informing her of [JON] ['S] appointment as lord commander of the [NIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] . [RAMSAY] then brings up the reason why he summoned her , and shows her the crucified and partly flayed corpse of the [HOLD] [WOMAN] who promised to help [SANSA] if she lit a candle in the [BROKEN TOWER] . [RAMSAY] then reveals to [SANSA] that [REEK] , who seems miserable to have squashed [SANSA] ['S] only hope of an escape , came to him and told him everything . [SANSA] chokes back tears as a gleeful [RAMSAY] orders his [MEN] to take her back to her chamber . meanwhile , [BRIENNE] stares intently at [WINTERFELL] [CASTLE BLACK] from her room in the [INN] , waiting for the sign to rescue [SANSA] . 
 [STANNIS] ['S] troops make camp during a violent snowstorm . [DAVOS] seaworth meets with [STANNIS] and informs him that forty horses died the previous [NIGHT] and more will [DIE] [COME] sunset . the stormcrows , a sellsword company , have fled in the [NIGHT] . [DAVOS] thinks that they should go back to [CASTLE BLACK] and wait out the weather since they do not have enough food , but [STANNIS] stubbornly tells him that they will not retreat to [CASTLE BLACK] because he will not risk being known as the king who ran . as [WINTER] will soon arrive , they also run the risk of being stuck at [CASTLE BLACK] for years , during which the [BOLTONS] will regain their strength . seeing no other way to convince [STANNIS] otherwise , [DAVOS] leaves . 
 [STANNIS] asks [MELISANDRE] if she is sure of their victory at [WINTERFELL] . [MELISANDRE] assures him , reminding him that he also saw the vision of his victory in the flames , but [STANNIS] is not so sure what he saw anymore . [MELISANDRE] reassures him that her visions will [COME] true , but also states that a sacrifice , one with king's [BLOOD] , must be made in order to ensure their victory , implying that they sacrifice [SHIREEN] . [STANNIS] is infuriated by the suggestion and orders her to leave .

in the [THRONE] room , [DAENERYS] ponders on what to do with [TYRION] and [JORAH] . she asks [TYRION] why she shouldn't [KILL] him , since the [LANNISTERS] are enemies to her [HOUSE] . he claims to have killed both of his parents and by that he is an enemy to the [LANNISTERS] as well . [DAENERYS] isn't convinced that killing one's own familiy is a good reputation for someone in her service . [TYRION] counters by wondering aloud if she at least is worth his service . ordered to tell her why he has [COME] to her from the other [END] of the world , he explains how he learned about her own story from rumours and from [VARYS] . he says that she a lost girl born in a [STORM] , who with virtually no assistance managed to acquire a barbarian horde , an effective [ARMY] , [CONQUER] [THREE] [CITIES] , break the slave trade and hatch [THREE] [DRAGONS] might be worth living for when he lost everything he had lived for until then . he adds that [DAENERYS] needs his advice despite having a powerful [ARMY] and large [DRAGONS] , as she lacks both political experience and practical knowledge of [WESTEROS] . 
she eventually agrees to spare his life , but asks what to do about ser [JORAH] . she seems poised to fulfil her promise of killing him if she saw him again , as it would not do at all for a queen not to [KEEP] her word . [TYRION] defends [JORAH] , commenting that he is clearly devoted to her and quite possibly in love with her , but also that he did not trust her enough to inform her of his mission to spy on her for king [ROBERT] and that therefore he can not be trusted to stand by her side . but , he argues , just as a queen should [KEEP] true to her oaths , she should also not [KILL] those devoted to her . 
 [DAENERYS] exiles [JORAH] from the [CITY] . contemplating his greyscale , [JORAH] returns to [YEZZAN] zo qaggaz and offers to fight for him . he promises to lead [YEZZAN] ['S] team to the [GREAT SEPT] [PIT] and [WIN] the tournament for the queen after that [YEZZAN] can make a fortune selling [JORAH] on the [BLACK] market . 
later , [TYRION] and [DAENERYS] sit in her solar and have a talk about ambitions . when [TYRION] mentions what a horrible father [TYWIN] was , [DAENERYS] admits that she no longer has any illusions about her own father . [DAENERYS] is curious about the circumstances of [TYRION] ['S] murder of [TYWIN] . he wryly promises that if she decides not to [KILL] him then one day he will tell her , but on that day they will need a lot more wine than the large decanter they are drinking from . 
they discuss the role of [VARYS] in their stories and [TYRION] assures [DAENERYS] he trusts him , and that he's probably the reason she wasn't killed years ago . [TYRION] was convinced by [VARYS] that she could be a ruler who deserves his support . when [DAENERYS] asks how he can get her what she wants , [TYRION] nearly rolls his eyes at her desire for the [IRON THRONE] . he suggests that she might want to stay in [SLAVER] ['S] [BAY] and build a [NEW] kingdom for herself in [MEEREEN] , complimenting her on reopening the fighting pits and her upcoming political marriage . she assures him that she will stay and help stabilize [THINGS] , and make sure the slave trade stays [BROKEN] , but essos is not her [HOME] . [TYRION] counters that no one will support her in [WESTEROS] , but [DAENERYS] somewhat idealistically declares that the common people will support her . [TYRION] generously assumes that this will happen which it generally doesn't , but then he reminds [DAENERYS] that [MEEREEN] has been in a state of chaos [WITHOUT] the combined support of the [GREAT MASTERS] and the smallfolk , and extends this to [WESTEROS] and its [GREAT HOUSES] . he notes that [GREAT HOUSES] [TARGARYEN] and [STARK] are effectively [DEAD] due to the combined actions of their [TWO] terrible fathers . neither [HOUSE LANNISTER] nor [HOUSE BARATHEON] of [DRAGONSTONE] will ever support her claim in [LIGHT] of their histories with the [TARGARYENS] . [TYRION] says that leaves [HOUSE TYRELL] who might be willing to switch sides due to [CERSEI] ['S] recent schemes against them but that still isn't enough . [DAENERYS] stubbornly likens the [GREAT HOUSES] , including her own [HOUSE TARGARYEN] , to the spokes on a wheel , one on top and then others , and on and on , crushing the commoners beneath them in their struggle for supremacy . [TYRION] sarcastically warns that others have dreamed of stopping the wheel , but [DAENERYS] clarifies that she plans to break it . 
 [DAENERYS] decides [TYRION] will remain as her advisor , but confiscates the wine , as a drunk is of no use to her .

during the [NIGHT] at [STANNIS BARATHEON] ['S] [ARMY] camp , [MELISANDRE] gazes intently into the flames of her tent's brazier hoping to receive visions from the lord of [LIGHT] . in the distance , several tents burst into flames , sending confused [MEN] shouting , and one horse screams as he runs away on [FIRE] . during the [NIGHT] , [RAMSAY BOLTON] and twenty [MEN] raided the camp , burning much of their food supplies and heavy [SIEGE] weapons . hundreds of horses also died in the [FIRE] .

[STANNIS BARATHEON] asks how this could happen and [DAVOS] insists that the [BOLTONS] know the [NORTH] ['S] terrain better than they do so it was easy for a raiding party to sneak into camp . [STANNIS BARATHEON] suggests that the watchmen were either collaborating with the enemy or simply not attentive enough at their posts to allow such a disaster either way he orders them to be executed . [STANNIS BARATHEON] says to slaughter the [DEAD] horses for their meat , which should at least buy them a little time . 
 [STANNIS BARATHEON] ['S] demeanor becomes grave and half stunned , as he believes there is only one course of action to take . he starts by ordering [DAVOS] to return to [CASTLE BLACK] to ask for more supplies from [JON SNOW] . [DAVOS] is confused given that even if [JON SNOW] did decide to resupply them the provisions probably wouldn't reach them in time , and wonders why [STANNIS BARATHEON] would send him instead of just a messenger . [STANNIS BARATHEON] insists that it is because he needs his [HAND] of the king to engage in diplomacy to [WIN] [JON SNOW] over but in reality , [STANNIS BARATHEON] sends [DAVOS] away so he wouldn't be around to stop what [STANNIS BARATHEON] was planning on doing next . 
 [DAVOS] visits the tent of [STANNIS BARATHEON] ['S] daughter [SHIREEN] [STANNIS BARATHEON] to say goodbye . she is enjoying reading a [BOOK] by [GRAND] maester munkun about the [DANCE] of the [DRAGONS] , a major civil war in the history of the [SEVEN KINGDOMS] . they share a laugh about how a [KNIGHT] tried to [KILL] the dragon vhagar by sneaking up on it with a mirrored shield , but it didn't fool the dragon , who promptly roasted the [KNIGHT] . [DAVOS] gives her a wooden stag figurine he has been carving as a present . she asks why he has been so nice to her , and he explains that he felt bad that his son [MATTHOS] always insisted that his father learn to read and he [NEVER] did . [MATTHOS] died in the war , and by teaching [DAVOS] to read [SHIREEN] helped him fulfill his son's wish . 
some time after [DAVOS] leaves , [STANNIS BARATHEON] himself visits [SHIREEN] , visibly shaken but trying to speak to her kindly . he asks about her reading , and she explains that the [DANCE] of the [DRAGONS] was a [GREAT] civil war between [RHAENYRA] [TARGARYEN] and her half brother [AEGON] , each of whom thought they deserved to sit on the [IRON THRONE] . the [GREAT] lords of the [SEVEN KINGDOMS] each declared for one or the other , dividing the [REALM] in half , and tearing [WESTEROS] apart . brother fought brother and dragon fought dragon in the devastating war . it was a disaster for [HOUSE TARGARYEN] as well , who [NEVER] truly recovered . [STANNIS BARATHEON] asks who she would have chosen , [RHAENYRA] or [AEGON] , and she says she wouldn't have chosen either it was all of the choosing sides that plunged [WESTEROS] into civil war . [STANNIS BARATHEON] gravely responds that sometimes the world forces a [MAN] to choose even if he doesn't want to , but if he stays true to himself he knows what he must do , and then it isn't really a choice at all even if he hates doing it . [SHIREEN] says it's all right and she wants to help him , though he responds that she doesn't even know what he wants . she doesn't care and asks if there is any way she can help , and he says that there is . [SHIREEN] insists that she wants to , because she is princess [SHIREEN] of [HOUSE BARATHEON] , his daughter . they hug and he embraces her tightly and [STANNIS BARATHEON] whispers forgive me . 
later , [SHIREEN] exits her tent as well and sees all of the soldiers gathered around , and asks where her father is . [COMING] to the front of the assembly , she sees [MELISANDRE] in front of a wooden pyre with a large stake in the middle . she starts shouting to see her father , but is grabbed by soldiers who drag her to the pyre and tie her to the stake . [MELISANDRE] soothingly tries to calm her by saying that it will all be over soon . [SHIREEN] ['S] cries ring out through the camp , but no one intervenes . [STANNIS BARATHEON] and [SHIREEN] ['S] [MOTHER] [SELYSE] then appear in the crowd . [SHIREEN] sees them and begs her [MOTHER] and father to help , but they do nothing . [SELYSE] insists aloud to herself that the sacrifice is what the lord of [LIGHT] wants . 
 [STANNIS BARATHEON] watches as [SHIREEN] is sacrificed . 
 [MELISANDRE] begins praying and announces that they offer up the life of this girl to the lord of [LIGHT] , and sets the pyre on [FIRE] . as she explained to [STANNIS BARATHEON] before , she believes that sacrificing [SHIREEN] ['S] life which contains the power of a king's [BLOOD] will gain the lord of [LIGHT] ['S] favor , who in return will aid them in their time of need by lifting the blizzard . [STANNIS BARATHEON] believes that if they do nothing , they will remain snowbound and all starve to death here . [SHIREEN] continues to repeatedly cry [MOTHER] , please and father , please eventually even [SELYSE] , who only had a cold and non existent relationship with her daughter , suddenly breaks and rushes forward , begging that they can't go through with it . soldiers restrain her , however , and she sinks to the ground crying in despair . [SHIREEN] ['S] cries become even more frightened , but [STANNIS BARATHEON] continues to [WATCH] even as [SELYSE] sobs on the ground . as the flames begin to consume [SHIREEN] she wordlessly screams in pain and fear , and eventually even [STANNIS BARATHEON] can not [BEAR] to look anymore as she burns to death .

 [JAIME] sits and speaks with [DORAN] . 
 [JAIME LANNISTER] is escorted into the main apartments of the [WATER GARDENS] by [AREO] [HOTAH] , to be received by [PRINCE] [DORAN] [MARTELL] in a luxurious solar , along with [ELLARIA SAND] , [DORAN] ['S] son [TRYSTANE MARTELL] , and [JAIME LANNISTER] ['S] niece myrcella [STANNIS BARATHEON] . they lounge on a circle of couches , myrcella cuddling with [TRYSTANE MARTELL] . [JAIME LANNISTER] notes that myrcella is wearing a revealing [DORNISH] style dress now , and she says that the warm climate of [DORNE] agrees with her . 
 [COMING] to the point , [DORAN] asks [JAIME LANNISTER] why he has snuck in to [DORNE] to abduct myrcella back to king's [LANDING] . he says he feared for her safety , but when [DORAN] insists why he didn't just send a letter by messenger [RAVEN] , he explains that they received a threatening message myrcella's [JAIME LANNISTER] [LION] pendant jammed in the mouth of [DEAD] [VIPER] . [DORAN] glares at [ELLARIA SAND] , while a confused myrcella explains that her pendant was simply stolen from her room . 
 [JAIME LANNISTER] asks if [DORAN] intends to behead him , but acting more sympathetic now that [JAIME LANNISTER] revealed he was threatened [FIRST] he says that he will not , because he wishes to avoid war . he has seen what war can do , bodies piled on the battlefield and orphans left starving in [CITIES] at [HOME] , and he will not lead his people into that . [ELLARIA SAND] bluntly asks what he will do , break bread with the [LANNISTERS] however he says that is precisely what he will do , as wine is poured for [JAIME LANNISTER] , and he raises his own goblet and offers a toast to king [TOMMEN] , [FIRST] of his [NAME] , [LONG] [MAY] he reign . [JAIME LANNISTER] returns the toast but [ELLARIA SAND] deliberately pours out her wine onto the floor in disgust . 
 [DORAN] asks if [TOMMEN] indeed commands that his sister be returned to the capital , and [JAIME LANNISTER] politely says he does , to which [DORAN] says he can not disobey his king myrcella will return to king's [LANDING] . she is upset for a moment , but then [DORAN] explains his solution his son [TRYSTANE MARTELL] will go along with them , to take over the seat on the [SMALL COUNCIL] which [TYWIN] granted to [OBERYN] , but which was vacated by his death . [DORAN] insists that for the alliance between the [IRON THRONE] and [DORNE] to continue , the engagement of [TRYSTANE MARTELL] and myrcella must stand , and [TRYSTANE MARTELL] will simply take his uncle [OBERYN] ['S] place on the [SMALL COUNCIL] . [JAIME LANNISTER] finds [DORAN] ['S] request entirely reasonable , and myrcella is ecstatic that she will not be separated from [TRYSTANE MARTELL] , so [JAIME LANNISTER] agrees . [ELLARIA SAND] gets up to leave and snaps that it is no wonder that [DORAN] can not stand , because he has no spine . as she walks out he grabs her by the arm and lowers his voice , saying that she is the [MOTHER] of four of his nieces and for their sake he hopes she has a [LONG] and happy life but if she talks to him that way again , she will not . 
 [JAIME LANNISTER] then asks what fate will befall bronn , who is still imprisoned . bronn punched out [TRYSTANE MARTELL] when they tried to take myrcella , and [JAIME LANNISTER] is asked what the normal [PUNISHMENT] is for striking a [PRINCE] where he is from . [JAIME LANNISTER] politely insists that bronn was only following orders and they can't punish him for simply following [JAIME LANNISTER] ['S] commands . [TRYSTANE MARTELL] agrees , saying he has learned the value of [MERCY] from his father , but that he has one condition . 
in the prison cells , [NYMERIA] and [TYENE] [ELLARIA SAND] spar out of boredom , as [OBARA] tries to ignore them and get some sleep . the guards arrive and release bronn , and [TYENE] mocks him as he leaves . [AREO] leads bronn back to the solar where [DORAN] , [JAIME LANNISTER] , and the rest remain . bronn apologizes to [TRYSTANE MARTELL] when he sees him and says he didn't mean anything by hitting him before . [JAIME LANNISTER] then gladly informs bronn that the martells agreed to let bronn go with [JAIME LANNISTER] , but on one condition wordlessly , [AREO] then delivers it by striking bronn in the face with his elbow , the large guard captain hitting him so hard that he is knocked to the floor . thus his debt to [TRYSTANE MARTELL] is settled . 
later , in the courtyard , [AREO] brings [ELLARIA SAND] and the [SAND SNAKES] before [PRINCE] [DORAN] in his wheelchair . [DORAN] gives [ELLARIA SAND] an ultimatum she can either choose to swear allegiance to him and that she will not try something like this again , or she can choose death . restraining tears , she kneels and kisses his [HAND] . [DORAN] says that he believes in [SECOND] chances and she is forgiven but sternly warns her that he does not believe in third chances . 
 [ELLARIA SAND] then finds [JAIME LANNISTER] in a study writing a letter back to king's [LANDING] informing of his return . he writes very poorly , given that he is using his non dominant left [HAND] , and [ELLARIA SAND] remarks that he writes like a [SEVEN] year [OLD] . [ELLARIA SAND] notes how odd it is that she and [OBERYN] were looked down on for their sexuality in king's [LANDING] , and [JAIME LANNISTER] is scorned for his incestuous love for [CERSEI] to which he remains [SILENT] and gives no acknowledgement though a hundred years ago , if his [NAME] were [TARGARYEN] , no one would have blinked an eye at such a relationship . cryptically perhaps spurred by [DORAN] , she then says that she knows your daughter myrcella had no part in what befell [OBERYN] , and maybe even [JAIME LANNISTER] is innocent of that and indeed he is , as [OBERYN] volunteered for the trial by combat . she exits , and [JAIME LANNISTER] is left to ponder what seems to be her apology .

 [ARYA] , or [LANNA] , sells oysters , clams , and cockles on the canal streets . 
 [ARYA] , in her [LANNA] persona , is once again pushing her cart through the canal streets of [BRAAVOS] selling oysters , clams , and cockles . she passes the [THIN MAN] who sells insurance to sailors , having been given a mission by the [FACELESS MEN] to assassinate him with poisoned oysters . just as she reaches him , however , she stops in her tracks and stares fixedly on a boat at the dock which has caught her full attention . stepping out of the boat is master of coin [MACE] [TYRELL] and the commander of his guards is none other than ser [MERYN TRANT] of the [KINGSGUARD] , one of the names on [ARYA] ['S] [KILL] list which she recites as a daily prayer . [MERYN TRANT] helped betray her father and killed her [WATER] dancing trainer [SYRIO FOREL] . [MACE] was sent by [CERSEI LANNISTER] to treat with the [IRON BANK] of [BRAAVOS] , which has started calling in the [CROWN] ['S] massive debts , and at least try to gain a little more time to deal with the problem from the bankers . [MACE] is greeted at the dock by the [IRON BANK] ['S] representative , [TYCHO] nestoris . [MACE] addresses [TYCHO] politely and amiably , though he doesn't realize that his jokes aren't really funny . all the while [ARYA] remains frozen and staring at ser [MERYN TRANT] , ignoring the [THIN MAN] ['S] requests for some of her oysters . 
 [ARYA] abandons her mission to assassinate the [THIN MAN] , and instead follows ser [MERYN TRANT] as he accompanies [MACE] . after visiting the [IRON BANK] building , [MERYN TRANT] and a few other [CERSEI LANNISTER] guards depart from [MACE] at [NIGHT] and go to visit a local brothel . [ARYA] sneaks into the brothel under the guise of simply selling her oysters and clams from a [HAND] basket . the bouncer brusco doesn't want her in at [FIRST] but the prostitute lhara , who is one of [ARYA] ['S] regular customers , tells him to let her stay , as oysters are held to be an aphrodisiac . [ARYA] sells a few and then makes her way to the back chambers where she spies on [MERYN TRANT] from behind some shutters . [MERYN TRANT] catches a brief look at her at one point , and she seems vaguely familiar , but he just shrugs it off it has been years since he last saw her , she is older and thus looks different , she has different [BRAAVOSI] style hair and clothes , and he doesn't think that [ARYA] would logically be in [BRAAVOS] . 
the brothel's madam presents several girls in succession to [MERYN TRANT] , but he passes on each as too [OLD] . she brings out her best and most expensive prostitute , a beautiful young [WOMAN] named anara , but [MERYN TRANT] again dismisses her as too [OLD] . the madam slowly realizes that [MERYN TRANT] is perversely interested in young girls who are barely teenagers around [ARYA] ['S] age so she brings out a very young girl who [MERYN TRANT] accepts gruffly , bluntly saying he expects another fresh one tomorrow . after he leaves the madam runs into [ARYA] and shoos her out . 
later , [ARYA] returns to the [HOUSE] of [BLACK] and [WHITE] empty handed , having abandoned her [FIRST] mission for the [FACELESS MEN] . when [JAQEN H] ['GHAR] asks what happened , she lies to him and says that the [THIN MAN] simply wasn't hungry today and didn't order any of her oysters . [JAQEN H] quips that perhaps this is why he is a [THIN MAN] , and [ARYA] promises that she will follow through on the assassination tomorrow . she departs , and while [JAQEN H] seems to suspect that she was lying , he makes no outward reaction to it .

[ROOSE BOLTON] continues that they need her to rally the [NORTH] against the [LANNISTERS] , if need be , and subtly warns [RAMSAY] that if he fails to recapture her , his unborn brother will become his heir .

[EDDARD STARK] asks where his sister [LYANNA] is , but [DAYNE] simply wishes [EDDARD STARK] the best in the [WARS] to [COME] . the [TWO] [KINGSGUARD] draw their [SWORDS] , with ser [ARTHUR] saying , and now it begins , to which [EDDARD STARK] replies now it ends . the [TWO] sides clash , with [DAYNE] making short work of a few of [NED] ['S MERCY] northmen . ser [ARTHUR] slowly cuts down the number of northmen , but ser [GEROLD HIGHTOWER] falls to [NED] ['S MERCY] blade . eventually , ser [ARTHUR] duels [EDDARD STARK] one on one . [BRAN] expresses his shock at ser [ARTHUR] ['S MERCY] skills , with the [THREE EYED RAVEN] confirming that the sword of the morning is better than [NED] . [DAYNE] easily gains the upper [HAND] and kicks [NED] ['S MERCY] sword away from him , but is unprepared for [HOWLAND] stabbing him through the back of the [NECK] . [EDDARD STARK] seems visibly uncomfortable at winning this way , but unhesitatingly delivers the killing blow to the incapacitated ser [ARTHUR] . [BRAN] is shocked , as he had heard tales of this duel and [NEVER] expected his father to stand for such [THINGS] . 
 [EDDARD STARK] runs towards the [GEROLD HIGHTOWER] , having heard a [WOMAN] ['S MERCY] scream [COME] from one of its windows towards the [END] of the duel . [BRAN] runs to follow [EDDARD STARK] , calling out , but he is told it's time to go by the [THREE EYED RAVEN] . [NED] looks back for a [SECOND] , seemingly hearing [BRAN] , but then runs into the [GEROLD HIGHTOWER] . [BRAN] tries to follow , but he is forced out of the past and back into the cave by the [THREE EYED RAVEN] , saying he had stayed in the past for too [LONG] . [BRAN] is both angry and sad at this , but the [THREE EYED RAVEN] asserts it was for his safety , and again sternly reminds him that the past can not be changed . the [THREE EYED RAVEN] further states that he's waited a thousand years for [BRAN] to arrive , and that [BRAN] will not share the [THREE EYED RAVEN] ['S MERCY] destiny . but before he can leave the cave , [BRAN] must learn everything .

[MARGAERY TYRELL] replied that she wants to return to her family and her husband [TOMMEN] [BARATHEON] . the [HIGH SPARROW] respects her love for her family but tells her that attachment leads to sin , citing his experience as a cobbler . [MARGAERY TYRELL] manages to impress the [HIGH SPARROW] with her knowledge of the [BOOK] of the [STRANGER] , which she admits [SEPTA UNELLA] had read at her . the [HIGH SPARROW] chuckles and agrees that [SEPTA UNELLA] has a habit of reading at people instead of to them . 
the [HIGH SPARROW] recounts how in his youth he was a womanizer and drunkard . he underwent a conversion experience the morning after an orgy , as his drunken guests lay naked all around his [HOUSE] . tired of what he was now perceiving as a meaningless existence , the [HIGH SPARROW] then turned his life around and became a devoted member of the [FAITH] of the [SEVEN] . he then left his job as a cobbler and devoted his life to the poor and destitute . believing he has found a way to reach [MARGAERY TYRELL] , the [HIGH SPARROW] allows her to visit her brother [LORAS] [MARGAERY TYRELL] .

 [JORAH MORMONT] and [DAARIO] bow down to their queen . 
stating that none of the khals is fit to lead the [DOTHRAKI] , [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] declares that she will lead them herself . after a pause , [KHAL MORO] and the khals burst into laughter . [DANY] reminds them that her husband , in the same temple in which they all now sit , declared that he would lead a [DOTHRAKI] [ARMY] across the [NARROW SEA] to retake the [IRON THRONE] for his khaleesi and that all the khals have done since is to raid and plunder villages in lieu of any meaningful conquest . disgusted with her insolence , [KHAL MORO] declares that she will be raped by each of the khals , then by all of their bloodriders , and then , if she is still alive , by their horses . [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] is unfazed by the threats , as she knocks down the braziers in the hut , setting everything aflame . the khals desperately attempt to escape the rapidly spreading [FIRE] , only to find the temple's only [DOOR] barred , the bodies of the [TWO] [MEN] guarding it lying [DEAD] [OUTSIDE] . 
as the flames [CLIMB] higher , the [DOSH KHALEEN] and khalasars gather in confusion . eventually , the doors collapse and [DAENERYS TARGARYEN] emerges , naked and unburned , with the entire leadership present at [VAES DOTHRAK] [DEAD] . many of the assembled bow immediately , with the [HIGH] [PRIESTESS] and the rest of the [DOSH KHALEEN] following after a moment . [JORAH MORMONT] and [DAARIO] move to the front of the crowd and bow last .

the [THREE EYED RAVEN] shows [BRAN] a vision of a heart tree amid spirals of standing stones in a lush green valley . his vision shows [LEAF] and other [CHILDREN] of the [FOREST] talking amongst themselves , then looking eagerly at a captive bound to the tree . [LEAF] approaches and forces a dragonglass dagger into the captive's chest . the captive screams , but does not [DIE] , instead becoming the [FIRST WHITE WALKER] . 
 [BRAN] immediately confronts [LEAF] about creating the [WHITE WALKERS] in the [FIRST WHITE WALKER] place . [LEAF] tries to explain that they were at war with the [FIRST MEN] and were desperate . later , [BRAN] is the only one in the cave awake and is anxious to warg back into the [WEIRWOOD] tree . [BRAN] wargs into the tree by himself and sees the [ARMY] of the [DEAD] . he slowly walks through the [ARMY] until he comes to a space occupied by four [WHITE WALKERS] , including the [NIGHT] king . as [BRAN] becomes aware that the the [NIGHT] king and the [DEAD] are now able to see him , the [NIGHT] king grabs his arm , branding him with an icy mark . he breaks out of the vision with a scream waking the others . the [THREE EYED RAVEN] tells [BRAN] , [MEERA] and [HODOR] that the [NIGHT] king is now able to locate [BRAN] and able to bypass the powerful magic keeping the [WHITE WALKERS] and the wights out of the cave . as a result , they must leave now and [BRAN] must become the [THREE EYED RAVEN] . [BRAN] asks whether he is ready , and the [THREE EYED RAVEN] says no at which point [BRAN] ['S] eyes whiten as he enters another vision . 
as [MEERA] and [HODOR] are preparing to leave they notice the air is so cold their breath is visible , indicating the arrival of the [ARMY] of the [DEAD] [OUTSIDE] of the cave . the [NIGHT] king and [THREE EYED RAVEN] [WHITE WALKERS] start marching towards the cave . the [CHILDREN] of the [FOREST] try using magic projectiles to fend the [WHITE WALKERS] off , but are overwhelmed . they [LIGHT] a [FIRE] around the entrance which prevents the wights from entering but the [WHITE WALKERS] extinguish a pathway and [WALK] through . the wights [END] up climbing over the [WEIRWOOD] and dropping through roots at the top of the cave . [MEERA] desperately tries to get [BRAN] out of the vision and attempts to get the frightened [HODOR] to carry [BRAN] away to no avail . using a dragonglass tipped spear , [MEERA] kills the [FIRST WHITE WALKER] that enters , and fights alongside the remaining [CHILDREN] of the [FOREST] to try to fend off the wights until [BRAN] wakes up . wights begin to swarm the cave , killing all of the [CHILDREN] of the [FOREST] except for [LEAF] , as [MEERA] starts yelling at [BRAN] to warg into [HODOR] . 
in the vision , [BRAN] is at [WINTERFELL] watching [NED STARK] say goodbye to his father , [RICKARD] [NED STARK] , before being sent to the [VALE] as a ward . while still in the vision , [BRAN] hears [MEERA] ['S] cries to warg into [HODOR] and the [THREE EYED RAVEN] tells him to listen to her . [BRAN] wargs into both the present day [HODOR] in the cave and [WYLIS] , the young version of [HODOR] in his vision . 
 [WYLIS] seizing , as his [WORDS] [HOLD] the [DOOR] evolve into [HODOR] . 
the [HODOR] in the cave puts [BRAN] ['S] body on a sled and starts hauling him down a tunnel leading out of the cave with [LEAF] and [MEERA] , as [BRAN] ['S] direwolf [SUMMER] is killed attacking the wights . as the wights are closing in on them , [LEAF] sacrifices herself , using magic to cause a huge explosion , buying the other [THREE EYED RAVEN] enough time to get to a [DOOR] at the [END] of the tunnel . while the [THREE EYED RAVEN] and [BRAN] are still sharing a vision , the [NIGHT] king kills the [THREE EYED RAVEN] , and his figure within [BRAN] ['S] vision blows away as ashes and rags . 
with some difficulty [HODOR] pushes the [DOOR] open and pulls [BRAN] through , [COMING] back to help [MEERA] close the [DOOR] just as the wights approach . [MEERA] grabs [BRAN] ['S] sled and tells [HODOR] to bar the exit , shouting to [HOLD] the [DOOR] . inside [BRAN] ['S] vision , [WYLIS] notices [BRAN] , who links the present [HODOR] to the past [WYLIS] . [WYLIS] begins to seize when he enters the mind of his future self . as [MEERA] continues to yell [HOLD] the [DOOR] to present day [HODOR] , within [BRAN] ['S] vision [WYLIS] falls to the ground convulsing and starts repeating this same sentence in the midst of his seizure . eventually , [HOLD] the [DOOR] slurs into [HODOR] , as his condition deteriorates and it becomes apparent this is the moment [HODOR] lost the ability to say any other [WORDS] , and his destiny was fixed . 
present day [HODOR] braces himself against the [DOOR] [LONG] enough for [MEERA] to disappear into the [SNOW] with [BRAN] ['S] unconscious body on the sled . inevitably , the wights break through parts of the [WEIRWOOD] and begin scratching and stabbing a visibly distressed [HODOR] . with no possibility of escape , all that is shown at the [END] is young [WYLIS] in the past seizing and crying out [HODOR] .
