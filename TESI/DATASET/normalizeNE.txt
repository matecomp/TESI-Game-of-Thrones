[TYRION] [LANNISTER] then arrives and talks to [JON SNOW] , suggesting that he is too pricklish and quick to take offense when his illegitimacy is pointed out . he should take the insult and wear it like armor , so that no one can hurt him with it . when [JON SNOW] angrily asks [TYRION] what he knows about it , [TYRION] replies that all dwarfs are [BASTARDS] in their father's eyes . 
 [EDDARD STARK] and [CATELYN STARK] receive a letter in the [NIGHT] , delivered to maester [LUWIN] by a messenger from the [EYRIE] . the letter is from [CATELYN STARK] ['S] sister , lady [LYSA ARRYN] , the widow of [JON ARRYN] . in the letter , [LYSA ARRYN] says that [JON ARRYN] was murdered by the [LANNISTERS] and that they plan to conspire against king [ROBERT BARATHEON] .

 [ROBERT BARATHEON] agrees , but if they land and the knights of westeros take shelter behind their [CASTLE] walls , the [DOTHRAKI] could simply burn and pillage their way up and down the continent until the smallfolk accept viserys as their king regardless . [CERSEI] suggests that the unified armies of the [SEVEN KINGDOMS] could defeat them but [ROBERT BARATHEON] says she underestimates the skill and ability of one army with one leader and one purpose as compared to that of the scattered and patchwork armies of westeros . their discussion moves to [LYANNA] [EDDARD STARK] , which surprises [ROBERT BARATHEON] , as in seventeen years [CERSEI] has [NEVER] asked about her . he tells her that [LYANNA] ['S] death left in him a void that [SEVEN KINGDOMS] could not fill . he also tells her that their marriage [NEVER] had a chance of success because of the hold [LYANNA] ['S] memory has on him , and bitterly adds he can barely remember what she looked like . [CERSEI] says that she felt something for [ROBERT BARATHEON] once , even after they lost their [FIRST] [BOY] , for quite a while . she asks [ROBERT BARATHEON] if there was ever any chance for their marriage and he answers no . 
littlefinger brings [EDDARD STARK] to the last place [JON ARRYN] went before falling ill , which is one of littefinger's brothels . there [EDDARD STARK] meets another one of [ROBERT BARATHEON] ['S] [BASTARDS] , this time a girl , and her [MOTHER] , a blond whore named mhaegen . mhaegen remarks that her child has [ROBERT BARATHEON] ['S] nose and [BLACK] hair . [EDDARD STARK] asks littlefinger why [JON ARRYN] was searching for [ROBERT BARATHEON] ['S] [BASTARDS] but he says he doesn't know , offering the half hearted guess that maybe [ROBERT BARATHEON] suddenly took paternal interest in them . [EDDARD STARK] looks skeptical of that reason . 
leaving the brothel , [EDDARD STARK] , jory [CASSEL] , and the [TWO] guards that accompanied them are confronted by a large group of [LANNISTER] guardsmen led by ser [JAIME] [LANNISTER] . [JAIME] has heard of [TYRION] ['S] arrest and demands an explanation . [EDDARD STARK] says that [TYRION] was arrested on his orders . . 
 [EDDARD STARK] is stabbed through the leg by a [LANNISTER] guardsman . 
 [JAIME] threatens to [KILL] [EDDARD STARK] but [EDDARD STARK] points out that if he does , [TYRION] will [DIE] as well . [JAIME] acknowledges that this is true , so he says he will settle for killing [EDDARD STARK] ['S] [TOMMEN] instead . there is a brief engagement in which [EDDARD STARK] ['S] [TWO] guards , heward and wyl , are killed by [LANNISTER] spearmen . in response , ned and jory fight and [KILL] five of the [LANNISTER] soldiers . jory engages [JAIME] but is quickly killed when [JAIME] stabs him through the eye with a dagger . furious , [EDDARD STARK] crosses [SWORDS] with [JAIME] . [JAIME] is shocked and then exhilarated when the older ned is not as easily defeated as he expected . however , [JAIME] gradually starts to grow worried as ned's [HIGH] level of skill becomes apparent . just as they are ready to clash again , a [LANNISTER] guardsman steps in and stabs [EDDARD STARK] through the leg with a spear , disabling him . [JAIME] is annoyed at the dishonorable interruption and knocks out the guardsman . he departs , telling [EDDARD STARK] he wants his brother back .

later on , [ROBB] and his lords are debating on the route of their march , and on whether to march directly against [TYWIN LANNISTER] ['S] army or against [JAIME] ['S] army besieging riverrun . to get to [JAIME] , they need to cross the green fork of the river trident , and the only crossing is at the twins , held by the notoriously prickly and easily offended [LORD] [WALDER FREY] . a [TYWIN LANNISTER] scout is captured , and [ROBB] sends him back to warn [LORD] [TYWIN LANNISTER] that twenty thousand northern soldiers are marching against him .

[JOFFREY] then takes sansa up to the walls to see her father's head and makes her look at it . he cruelly mocks her , promising he will give her [ROBB STARK] ['S] head next . sansa quietly retorts that [ROBB STARK] might give her [JOFFREY] ['S] instead . infuriated , [JOFFREY] orders ser [MERYN TRANT] to beat her , as [CERSEI] has told him that a king should not hit his queen . sansa moves up behind [JOFFREY] , apparently preparing to shove him off the walkway to his death , but unexpectedly sandor [CLEGANE] dabs the [BLOOD] off her lip with a handkerchief and after [JOFFREY] leaves , tells her to give him what he wants . 
lancel and [CERSEI] . 
 [CERSEI] [LANNISTER] has taken a [NEW] lover , her cousin lancel who was king [ROBERT] ['S] squire . she also receives a letter informing her of [JAIME] ['S] capture . lancel is naked in [CERSEI] ['S] bedroom . the thought of being at war is exciting to him , as he has just been made a [NEW] young [KNIGHT] . he asks for the news of the war and asks what their next move is , but [CERSEI] tells him to shut up and get back in bed . 
grand maester [PYCELLE] takes the prostitute ros to bed , revealing that he is actually far less frail than he appears . he boasts to ros of the several [GREAT SEPT] kings he has served , lamenting [FIRST] how [AERYS TARGARYEN] devolved from a charming young [MAN] into a paranoid lunatic obsessed with [FIRE] , how [ROBERT BARATHEON] was a [GREAT SEPT] soldier , but perhaps not so ideal a king , before displaying his sycophantic loyalty to [JOFFREY] . 
yoren and arya . yoren has assembled a band of [NEW] recruits for the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] . pretending that arya is a [BOY] called arry , he has her join the group . also in the group are hot pie , lommy greenhands , and [GENDRY] , who unknown to him , is king [ROBERT BARATHEON] ['S] bastard son . he had been working for tobho mott , but with [ROBERT BARATHEON] [DEAD] , the secret funds being sent to mott stopped , so he fired [GENDRY] and told him he had to join the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] . hot pie and lommy try to bully arya into giving up needle , but she angrily draws the sword , warning that she has already killed one fat [BOY] and will happily do it again . [GENDRY] breaks up the argument by taking arya's side , threatening the boys with violence to [KEEP] them from picking on arya later . yoren now has to get them all to the [WALL] , a thousand leagues away , through the war torn [RIVERLANDS] . they set out .

[TYWIN] ['S] commanders are uncertain what to do , arguing about whether to strike while they still can , fall back and raise reinforcement armies , or sue for peace . [TYRION] points out that any chance of negotiating with [ROBB STARK] died when his father [EDDARD STARK] was executed . the [LANNISTER] army is now exposed , so [TYWIN] decides to retreat to [HARRENHAL] , the [GREAT] [CASTLE] on the northern shores of [GODS] eye , and use it as a base of operations . reluctantly impressed by [TYRION] ['S] astute judgment of the situation , [TYWIN] orders his son to go to king's landing and serve as acting [HAND] of the king in [TYWIN] ['S] stead . he is to bring [CERSEI] and [JOFFREY] to heel and prevent the young king from making more idiotic mistakes .

a silent sister working on a casualty at oxcross . 
the northern army under king [ROBB STARK] leads a surprise [NIGHT] time assault against an encamped [HOUSE LANNISTER] army , which was only manned by rennick and another [HOUSE LANNISTER] guardsman [GARDEN] of [BONES] , with his direwolf grey wind causing a considerable amount of damage . the [BATTLE] of oxcross is a smashing victory , following through on [ROBB STARK] ['S] promise to give [CERSEI] another whispering wood . 2 the next day [ROBB STARK] surveys the battlefield as silent sisters tend to both [ROBB STARK] and [HOUSE LANNISTER] wounded , while his bannerman , [LORD] [ROOSE BOLTON] of the dreadfort , argues that they should [KILL] all of the [HOUSE LANNISTER] soldiers they took prisoner , because they're having trouble supplying their own army and prisoners will slow them down . [ROBB STARK] disagrees , saying they will fight honorably and follow the [LAWS] of war . [ROOSE BOLTON] concedes that some of the [HOUSE LANNISTER] officers might have useful information they could be tortured into revealing , but [ROBB STARK] refuses , not wanting to give the [LANNISTERS] an excuse to torture his sisters , sansa and arya . 
 [ROBB STARK] sees a [WOMAN] battlefield healer treating a wounded [HOUSE LANNISTER] soldier . the prisoner protests when she tells him she has to amputate in order to save his life . [ROBB STARK] helps hold him down as she saws off the leg . the [WOMAN] , who introduces herself as [TALISA] of volantis , criticizes [ROBB STARK] for the need for this war . [ROBB STARK] doesn't want the [IRON THRONE] , just revenge on [JOFFREY] for his father's death . she is shocked to learn he doesn't care which king takes the [IRON THRONE] after they defeat [JOFFREY] having declared for neither of the [STANNIS BARATHEON] brothers . he just wants them to leave the [NORTH] alone afterward . she points out that for all the bloodshed they have caused , he hasn't hurt the ones who killed his father , [JOFFREY] and [TYWIN LANNISTER] . the [MEN] they slaughtered were not [TYWIN LANNISTER] ['S] main army but unwilling [BOY] soldiers and conscripts from the westerlands . 
the prisoners arrive at [HARRENHAL] . 
arya [ROBB STARK] , [GENDRY] , and hot pie are taken by ser [AMORY LORCH] ['S] group of soldiers to [HARRENHAL] , a vast but partially ruined [CASTLE] which was badly damaged during the [TARGARYEN] conquest three hundred years ago by [DRAGONS]' [FIRE] . arya's group is herded in with many other prisoners the [TYWIN LANNISTER] soldiers have taken , primarily peasant refugees from the [RIVERLANDS] . the commander of the entire [TYWIN LANNISTER] force is ser [GREGOR CLEGANE] , the [MOUNTAIN] that rides , previously declared an outlaw by [EDDARD STARK] for his raiding in the [RIVERLANDS] . now the positions are reversed , with [GREGOR CLEGANE] having the support of the [IRON THRONE] to brutalize the rivermen . the stench of corpses is so strong that arya notices it as soon as they are in sight of the [CASTLE] . the [TYWIN LANNISTER] soldiers under ser [GREGOR CLEGANE] particularly one known as the tickler sadistically torture many of the prisoners they have taken . one method used is to tie a bucket containing a rat to a [WOMAN] ['S] abdomen , and then to hold a flame to the back of the bucket so the rat will chew its way through the [WOMAN] ['S] guts . the prisoners are for the most part simple peasant refugees with no knowledge of the war , and the [TYWIN LANNISTER] soldiers are savagely torturing them just because they want to know where they [DEAD MAY NEVER DIE] have hid the few valuables they have . however , some are also asked if they know anything about a group known as the [BROTHERHOOD] . just as [GENDRY] is about to be tortured , [LORD] [TYWIN LANNISTER] arrives with the main host of his army , who have retreated to [HARRENHAL] to regroup after their loss at the [BATTLE] of the whispering wood . the main [TYWIN LANNISTER] army group led by [LORD] [TYWIN LANNISTER] is settling in to use [HARRENHAL] as their [NEW] main base for the ongoing campaign in the [RIVERLANDS] . 
leave her face , i like her pretty . 
 [TYWIN LANNISTER] orders an immediate halt to the tortures saving [GENDRY] , rationally pointing out how disproportionate it is relative to what little wealth the peasants might be hiding , and it would be far more efficient to put them to work around the [CASTLE] . as a blacksmith's apprentice , [GENDRY] ['S] skills are of particular use to them , and he is set to work . [TYWIN LANNISTER] instantly notices that arry is really a girl dressed up in [BOY] ['S] clothing , criticizing his soldiers for being too foolish to notice . when he asks her why she's dressed as a [BOY] , arya simply explains that it was safer . [TYWIN LANNISTER] is impressed with her intelligence , and takes her on as his [NEW] cupbearer while his army is based at the [CASTLE] . 
in king's landing , king [JOFFREY BARATHEON] is furious when he hears of [ROBB STARK] ['S] decisive victory against [TYWIN LANNISTER] forces . he has sansa [ROBB STARK] brought before the assembled court in the recently redecorated [IRON THRONE] room , which now boasts [IRON THRONE] spikes on many surfaces and roaring fires surrounding the pillars . lancel [TYWIN LANNISTER] tells sansa and the assembled nobles that [ROBB STARK] only won the [BATTLE] with trickery and sorcery . at [FIRST] , [JOFFREY BARATHEON] sadistically menaces sansa by brandishing a crossbow at her and openly toying with the thought of killing her right in front of the [IRON THRONE] to send her brother a message . despite being clearly terrified , sansa refuses to give [JOFFREY BARATHEON] the satisfaction of scaring her and continues to firmly pledge her loyalty . annoyed , he reluctantly concedes to his [MOTHER] ['S] insistence that they need sansa alive , lowering the crossbow and ordering her to stand . . 
sansa , beaten and stripped in front of the entire court . 
 [JOFFREY BARATHEON] then sits down on the [IRON THRONE] and commands ser [MERYN TRANT] of the [KINGSGUARD] to beat and strip her as [PUNISHMENT] , but instructs [MERYN TRANT] to leave her face because i like her pretty . ser [MERYN TRANT] punches sansa violently in the stomach and strikes her in the back of the legs with the flat of his sword , causing her to fall down . he then rips open the back of her gown , leaving her partially naked from the waist up . as the beating continues , the entire court watches in horror , particularly a disgusted sandor [GREGOR CLEGANE] . but despite being filled with dozens of knights and officials , no one intervenes out of fear of [JOFFREY BARATHEON] ['S] wrath . 
a furious [TYRION] [TYWIN LANNISTER] marches in and puts a stop to the spectacle . he orders someone to cover sansa up and sandor immediately steps forward , taking off his cloak and proceeds to gently wrap it around her . [TYRION] turns his wrath upon [JOFFREY BARATHEON] , berating his actions as sansa is his future wife and queen that he is publicly shaming and the fact that [JOFFREY BARATHEON] doesn't pause to think how politically disastrous it would be for their allies to see him having his guards beat a valuable political hostage to a bloody pulp . furious , [JOFFREY BARATHEON] proclaims that he was punishing her . denouncing his nephew as a halfwit , [TYRION] points out the absurdity of punishing sansa for her brother's actions miles away in a war that [JOFFREY BARATHEON] himself started . now completely enraged , [JOFFREY BARATHEON] bellows that as king , he can do whatever he pleases , but [TYRION] again coldly counters that the mad king thought he could do as he pleased too , which led to him being overthrown and killed . 
 [JOFFREY BARATHEON] torments ros to send a message to [TYRION] . 
when ser [MERYN TRANT] tries to support the king , [TYRION] silences the [KINGSGUARD] by ordering [BRONN] to [KILL] [MERYN TRANT] if the [KNIGHT] opens his mouth again . [TYRION] comforts the shaken sansa and personally escorts her out of the [HALL] . he asks her whether she wants to [END] her engagement to the king , but she continues to parrot the lines that she loves [JOFFREY BARATHEON] and will uphold her duty . impressed , [TYRION] remarks that she has learned how to survive around [JOFFREY BARATHEON] and might just make it out of her situation alive , respectfully calling her lady [ROBB STARK] . 
 [BRONN] suggests to [TYRION] that as an angry young [WOMAN] , maybe what [JOFFREY BARATHEON] needs is to have sex with a [WOMAN] , and that they should set him up with a prostitute . [TYRION] agrees that maybe this would give [JOFFREY BARATHEON] a chance to release his frustrations away from sansa . indeed , he might even be grateful for the gesture given that he didn't have much of a father figure in [ROBERT BARATHEON] to set him straight , doing something nice for the [BOY] might even be the [SECOND] chance [JOFFREY BARATHEON] needs to re establish a relationship with a male family figure . so [TYRION] arranges for [TWO] prostitutes from littlefinger's brothel , ros and daisy , to entertain [JOFFREY BARATHEON] . unfortunately , the attempt fails horrifically instead of trying to have sex with the prostitutes , [JOFFREY BARATHEON] brings a loaded crossbow into the bedchamber . at crossbow point , [JOFFREY BARATHEON] forces ros to beat daisy unconscious , and then to dump her body in [TYRION] ['S] chambers , to send his uncle a message warning him not to interfere with his handling of sansa again . 
as [TYRION] works in his chamber late at [KNIGHT] , his cousin lancel [TYWIN LANNISTER] knocks on his [DOOR] delivering orders from [CERSEI] to release grand maester [PYCELLE] from the dungeon at once . despite their [BLOOD] relationship lancel clearly holds [TYRION] in contempt and openly calls him imp . curious , [TYRION] asks why lancel is so late delivering the message . blundering into a rather obvious trap , lancel retorts that he always delivers messages immediately and is [NEVER] late . [TYRION] then simply points out how odd it is that lancel would be [COMING] from [CERSEI] ['S] bedchambers in the middle of the [KNIGHT] . lancel nervously says [CERSEI] often works tirelessly keeping late hours , but [TYRION] also notices that he reeks of [CERSEI] ['S] favorite lavender oil perfume . [TYRION] enquires whether lancel was made a [KNIGHT] before or after he started sharing [CERSEI] ['S] bed . lancel falls apart , saying that [CERSEI] ['S] father ordered him to obey her every command when he became a squire to king [ROBERT BARATHEON] . [TYRION] sarcastically asks if [CERSEI] forced him to have sex with her too . [TYRION] wonders aloud what [JOFFREY BARATHEON] would do if he found out that lancel had not only killed [JOFFREY BARATHEON] ['S] father but was also sleeping with his [MOTHER] . lancel gets down on his knees and pleads for his life . [TYRION] gently instructs lancel that he won't tell , but from now on , lancel must report everything [CERSEI] does back to [TYRION] . as lancel leaves , he also casually agrees that he will accede to [CERSEI] ['S] request and [FREE] [PYCELLE] if she wants him as a pet , though he doesn't want him back on the small council . 
petyr littlefinger [BAELISH] arrives at king [RENLY] [JOFFREY BARATHEON] ['S] camp as a political envoy from king [JOFFREY BARATHEON] at king's landing . he tries to gain [RENLY] ['S] trust by implying that if [RENLY] does march on the capital , he will help take down the [LANNISTERS] from within it is unclear if he is lying , but he is also ready to jump ship if the [LANNISTERS] lose , and [STANNIS] is not an option , because [STANNIS] despises littlefinger [RENLY] is tempted by the notion , despite his dislike for littlefinger . littlefinger then has a conversation with queen [MARGAERY] [TYRELL] in which he tries to intimidate her by hinting that her husband is homosexual . he does not anticipate that [MARGAERY] seems to already know and not to care . [MARGAERY] is not a naive ingenue like sansa [ROBB STARK] but versed in court strategies she honestly believes that [RENLY] is the best candidate for king , and voluntarily entered into a paper marriage to secure the political alliance between [RENLY] and [HOUSE TYRELL] . [BAELISH] then meets with [CATELYN STARK] , who is still furious at his betrayal of her husband to his death . [BAELISH] [FIRST] tries to kindle a romance with her , saying that now they are both [FREE] , it [MAY] be that they can be together . [CATELYN STARK] simply draws a dagger and demands that he stop speaking . discouraged , he moves on to present [TYRION] ['S] offer that the [LANNISTERS] want to make a prisoner exchange with the [STARKS] if they release [JAIME] [TYWIN LANNISTER] , queen [CERSEI] will release both sansa [CATELYN STARK] and arya [CATELYN STARK] [BAELISH] lies about the [LANNISTERS] having arya . [CATELYN STARK] insists that [ROBB STARK] would [NEVER] allow the exchange , but littlefinger tries to manipulate her love for her imprisoned daughters . as a show of good faith from [TYRION] , [BAELISH] brings forward a pair of silent sisters carrying a box containing the remains of ned [ROBB STARK] . deeply grieving , [CATELYN STARK] tells petyr to get out . she looks at the [BONES] with pain , but then shuts the box with a look of resolve on her face . 
the shadow wrenches itself [FREE] from melisandre's womb . 
king [STANNIS BARATHEON] then arrives at [RENLY] ['S] camp , along with the [RED] priestess melisandre and ser [DAVOS] seaworth in his retinue . [STANNIS BARATHEON] has [COME] to treat with [RENLY] and give him the chance to willingly relinquish his claim and serve his older brother . [RENLY] , along with his [KINGSGUARD] members brienne and ser [LORAS] [HOUSE TYRELL] , counters that no one wants [STANNIS BARATHEON] to be king . [RENLY] also scoffs at [STANNIS BARATHEON]' conversion to the religion of the [LORD] of light . [CATELYN STARK] criticizes both brothers for acting like sulking [CHILDREN] . [STANNIS BARATHEON] counters that it is odd that [CATELYN STARK] is standing alongside [RENLY] , given that her own husband ned [CATELYN STARK] rejected [RENLY] ['S] initial plan to claim the [THRONE] and supported [STANNIS BARATHEON] as [ROBERT BARATHEON] ['S] rightful heir , even at the cost of his own life . in a display of leniency that is uncharacteristic for him , [STANNIS BARATHEON] offers [RENLY] that if he relinquishes his claim , [STANNIS BARATHEON] will grant him his [OLD] seat on the small council , and even [NAME] him as his heir unless [STANNIS BARATHEON] ever has a son in the future . [CATELYN STARK] reminds [STANNIS BARATHEON] that their common enemy is the [LANNISTERS] , but he will not hear it , again asserting his right to the [IRON THRONE] . [RENLY] states that the 100 , 000 soldiers waving his banners makes him king , and [STANNIS BARATHEON]' small army is hopelessly outnumbered . [STANNIS BARATHEON] says that they shall see the next morning when their armies clash , and he departs . as she leaves melisandre warns , look to your sins [LORD] [RENLY] , for the [NIGHT] is [DARK] and full of terrors . [RENLY] watches his brother fade into the distance and asks his companions if they can believe that he loved [STANNIS BARATHEON] once . 
at king [STANNIS BARATHEON]' command , ser [DAVOS] rows melisandre to some caves located near [RENLY] ['S] camp . [DAVOS] knows these caves from his [OLD] smuggling days . melisandre asks him about whether he desires her , and his views on the conflict they are involved in between right and wrong , insisting that she is on the side of good . they find the way through the caves is blocked by metal bars . melisandre takes off her cloak revealing that she is naked and heavily pregnant and promptly gives birth to a creature made entirely of shadow , as ser [DAVOS] looks on in horror .

[HOUSE LANNISTER] ['S] [NEW] allies [HOUSE TYRELL] begin to settle into the capital . [TYWIN LANNISTER] bluntly tells his son [TYRION] that he intends to disinherit him . this comes as a shock , because his older brother [JAIME] gave up all right to inherit his father's [LANDS] when he joined the [KINGSGUARD] , and [TYRION] is rightfully the next in line of succession . for that matter , despite all evidence to the contrary , [TYWIN LANNISTER] refuses to believe that [TYRION] was in any way helpful in the defense of the city or during his months as acting [HAND] of the king . instead , [TYWIN LANNISTER] obstinately maintains his belief that [TYRION] is a whore mongering , drunken , ill made , spiteful little creature , and that he is lying about all of his accomplishments out of envy . [TYWIN LANNISTER] is particularly insulted that [TYRION] brought his mistress , shae , to the capital when [TYWIN LANNISTER] explicitly told him not to , which makes [TYWIN LANNISTER] convince himself that [TYRION] was in bed with shae most of the time while events spiraled out of control . when [TYRION] asks why his father is doing this , [TYWIN LANNISTER] is shocked as if [TYRION] insulted him , and says it should be obvious as [TYRION] killed his [MOTHER] joanna in childbirth so that he might enter the world . [TYWIN LANNISTER] says that the [LAWS] of [TOMMEN] say he has to let [TYRION] use his family [NAME] , but that he wishes he could prove [TYRION] wasn't his son , so his very existence would not continue to make a mockery out of the [NAME] [TYWIN LANNISTER] which he stole from [TYWIN LANNISTER] . [TYRION] fumes at the situation to his sellsword [BRONN] , who has recently been knighted as a reward for his service in the [BATTLE] of the [BLACKWATER] . he now styles himself as ser [BRONN] of the [BLACKWATER] , and while possessing no [LANDS] , wealth , or title , this drastically elevates his social standing and in his mind , his pay .

[CERSEI] admonishes [MARGAERY] ['S] boldness and reminds her that her impromptu charity work took place on the same streets where the royal party was assaulted weeks earlier . 
when [JOFFREY BARATHEON] naively defends [MARGAERY] and criticizes his [MOTHER] , [CERSEI] realizes that she is on the verge of being outmaneuvered . [CERSEI] only knows how to rule through fear , but [MARGAERY] knows how to [TYWIN LANNISTER] the love of the people she rules over , a skill [CERSEI] lacks . sansa [STARK] and shae sit on the docks watching ships arrive and depart . sansa wants to play a [GAME] making up stories about where the ships are headed , but shae , in typical fashion , is uninterested . petyr [BAELISH] arrives to speak with sansa . 
she displays an eagerness to leave as soon as possible . he suggests that when he next leaves the capital by sea , she might be able to stow away . sansa advises him not to give her too many details since she is a terrible liar . meanwhile , ros , who seems to be acting as littlefinger's aide , reminisces about the day sansa was born , when all the bells in [WINTERFELL] were rung in celebration . she asks shae to look out for sansa , particularly in regards to littlefinger . 
on dragonstone , king [STANNIS BARATHEON] ['S] shattered forces regroup after being almost totally destroyed in the [BATTLE] of the [BLACKWATER] . [DAVOS] seaworth is rescued from the sea by salladhor saan after being thrown overboard by the wildfire blast in the [BATTLE] . forlorn over the death of his son [MATTHOS] , [DAVOS] feels that melisandre has led [STANNIS BARATHEON] to disaster , and is horrified to hear from salladhor that she has begun to conduct human sacrifices . after the defeated remnant of [STANNIS BARATHEON]' forces returned to the island , melisandre ordered any who spoke out against her to be burned alive as offerings to the [LORD] of light . [DAVOS] convinces salladhor to bring him to dragonstone . he finds [STANNIS BARATHEON] despondent , sitting in the chamber of the painted table alone with melisandre . [DAVOS] openly calls melisandre his enemy , condemns her for conducting human sacrifices , and says she is leading [STANNIS BARATHEON] astray . she counters that it was [DAVOS] who urged [STANNIS BARATHEON] not to bring her to the [BATTLE] , and implies that it was actually [DAVOS]' fault that thousands of their [TOMMEN] burned to death , including his own son . at the mention of his son [DAVOS] draws a knife on her in a fit of anger , but he is restrained by the guards , and [STANNIS BARATHEON] orders him put in the dungeon . 
 [DAVOS] tries to [KILL] melisandre . 
in the [RIVERLANDS] , the morale of king [ROBB STARK] ['S] army is starting to wane . they have not had a significant victory since the [BATTLE] of oxcross months ago , and the news of the [LANNISTERS]' victory over [STANNIS BARATHEON] and [NEW] alliance with the tyrells piles bad news upon bad news . [ROBB STARK] has won every [BATTLE] he has ever fought , but the [LANNISTERS] finally realized it was too difficult to try to attack him head on , so they have shifted to the [NEW] strategy of simply fleeing ahead of [ROBB STARK] ['S] army . [ROBB STARK] ['S] forces have won many small but also insignificant minor victories , as the [LANNISTERS] are now determined to simply wait [ROBB STARK] out and exhaust his army far from [HOME] while they slowly rebuild their own numbers and gain [NEW] allies . in frustration , [ROBB STARK] launches a [NEW] offensive to the east which takes the [GREAT SEPT] [CASTLE] of [HARRENHAL] , which [TYWIN LANNISTER] had been using it as the main [TYWIN LANNISTER] forward base in the [RIVERLANDS] during the [FIRST] year of the war . however , [ROBB STARK] does not find the decisive victory he was hoping for [TYWIN LANNISTER] withdrew his garrison to king's landing to counter the attack by [STANNIS BARATHEON] , and didn't even bother wasting any [TOMMEN] on a token defense of the [CASTLE] . [ROBB STARK] and his forces are further demoralized to find that the [LANNISTERS] massacred [TWO] hundred northern and [RIVERLANDS] prisoners of war before they left , and the courtyards are choked with piles of bodies . they do find one survivor , a maester named qyburn .

[DAENERYS] expresses interest in expanding her tiny [DOTHRAKI] khalasar most of them are seasick because the [DOTHRAKI] have [NEVER] traveled on ships before , but [JORAH MORMONT] says that other [DOTHRAKI] will only join her if they think she is strong , and for that she needs an army . 
upon arriving at astapor , [DAENERYS] is given a tour of the [UNSULLIED] barracks by the [UNSULLIED] ['S] owner , kraznys mo nakloz , with his slave girl missandei translating his low valyrian into the common tongue of westeros for [DAENERYS] . they explain that the [UNSULLIED] are trained for [BATTLE] from the age of five , and that only one in four recruits survives the training . kraznys also demonstrates that the [UNSULLIED] do not fear pain or death by slicing off the nipple of one soldier much to [DAENERYS] ['S] disgust , who not only shows no sign of pain , but thanks the slavemaster for the opportunity to serve him . kraznys goes on to explain that the [UNSULLIED] are trained to show no [MERCY] or weakness by killing a newborn slave child in front of its [MOTHER] at the [END] of their training . [DAENERYS] is outraged by this , but still asks how many [UNSULLIED] are available . she is told there are eight thousand soldiers for sale and that she has until the next day to make a decision . 
en route back to their ship , ser [JORAH MORMONT] urges that [DAENERYS] should purchase the [UNSULLIED] , arguing that under her command , these slave soldiers will have a far better quality of life serving her than they would under kraznys and his ilk .

 [BRAN] [STARK] dreams that he is walking and hunting in the woods he sees the mysterious three eyed raven again . as he aims his bow , he relives his memories of when he was practicing archery with [JON SNOW] and [ROBB] , and hears the voice of his father [EDDARD] . [BRAN] shoots at the raven but misses . a young [STRANGER] appears . the [BOY] tells [BRAN] that he can not shoot the raven , because he is the raven . [BRAN] awakens suddenly , worrying hodor for a moment but he says that he is fine . osha says they have enough problems [WITHOUT] [DARK] dreams . [BRAN] , rickon , osha , hodor , and the direwolves summer and shaggydog continue to head [NORTH] from [WINTERFELL] to the [WALL] . 
later , the same [BOY] from the dream approaches their camp in the woods unarmed . summer snarls at him initially but then sniffs his [HAND] and turns away . osha comes up behind the [BOY] with a sharpened wooden spear , only for the [BOY] ['S] sister to surprise osha and put a knife to her throat . the [BOY] introduces himself as jojen [REED] , and his sister as meera [REED] . [HOUSE REED] are loyal bannermen of [HOUSE STARK] , and they have been searching for [BRAN] and rickon so that they can protect them . 
when they are on the move again , jojen and [BRAN] discuss his [WOLF] dreams . jojen explains that [BRAN] himself is a warg . jojen says that it starts out as vivid dreams seeing the world through his [WOLF] ['S] eyes , but with practice he will be able to consciously enter the mind of his [WOLF] and control its actions . [BRAN] asks if prophetic dreams are part of being a warg , but jojen explains that's a different , related ability . the sight allows those who possess it to see events that haven't happened yet , or events that happened long before they were born , or events happening now but thousands of miles away . jojen confirms that [BRAN] ['S] dream of his father [EDDARD] the day he died was an example of the sight , and that jojen himself had a similar dream the same day . he says that when he told his father , [LORD] howland [HOUSE REED] , he openly wept , for he correctly realized that his son's dream signified that [EDDARD] was [DEAD] . [BRAN] says that howland was a [GREAT] friend of his father [EDDARD] ['S] who fought alongside him during [ROBERT BARATHEON] ['S] rebellion . jojen says that howland doesn't like to talk about the war much . jojen confirms that [BRAN] wasn't simply experiencing a vision of jojen in his earlier dream , but that he reached out with his mind to contact [BRAN] in his dream , and that he [REMEMBERS] seeing the three eyed raven too . 
at an indeterminate location , theon [GREYJOY] has been chained up in a dungeon after being knocked out before the sack of [WINTERFELL] . [MEN] [COME] in , some wearing ironborn clothing , and interrogate him . when he asks what they want , one of his captors says he wants to do this and starts prying his fingernails off with a knife . later they use a foot press to torture him , while also slowly turning a screw into his foot until it is bleeding freely , repeatedly asking him why he captured [WINTERFELL] , but apparently not caring about the answers he gives . theon at [FIRST] tells them the simple truth that he wanted to take and hold [WINTERFELL] while the [NORTH] was vunerable to impress his father , then starts frantically lying , saying he hates the [STARKS] and is their enemy , desperately trying to figure out what his captors want him to tell them . when the guards leave they put a bag over his head . a servant [BOY] comes over to theon and unwinds the foot press , and tells him that he has been sent by his sister yara to rescue him . however , he must wait until nightfall when the [CASTLE] is asleep , so he puts the bag back on and the desperate theon is left alone crying for help . 
king [JOFFREY BARATHEON] is being fitted for [NEW] clothes in his chambers , in preparation for his upcoming [WEDDING] to [MARGAERY] [TYRELL] . his [MOTHER] [CERSEI] begins to criticize [MARGAERY] , saying that she is only charitable to the poor to build up support for herself , and also saying that she thinks she dresses like a harlot . however , [JOFFREY BARATHEON] barely tolerates his [MOTHER] ['S] chiding and dismissively tells her off . 
shae dresses sansa [HOUSE STARK] in her chambers , and warns sansa about petyr littlefinger [BAELISH] . she points out that [BAELISH] has offered to help sansa for nothing in return , which probably means that he's after something . sansa naively says that he's an [OLD] friend of her [MOTHER] ['S] , believing that should be reason enough . shae suggests that [BAELISH] is actually sexually attracted to sansa . this disturbs sansa , but she thinks it is simply impossible , as [BAELISH] is so much older than her . shae continues to warn sansa that [BAELISH] is manipulative and [MEN] usually only want one thing from pretty young ladies , and love often isn't what they're after . sansa warns the tyrells that [JOFFREY BARATHEON] is a monster . 
ser [LORAS] [TYRELL] arrives at the [DOOR] and escorts sansa to the [GARDENS] to meet with [MARGAERY] and their grandmother , lady [OLENNA TYRELL] . sansa reminds [LORAS] that they met once before at the tourney of the [HAND] , and he takes his leave after introducing her . lady [OLENNA TYRELL] is a cunning and intelligent [WOMAN] who speaks her mind , and bluntly says that her son [MACE] was a fool for supporting [RENLY] [JOFFREY BARATHEON] ['S] claim to the [THRONE] , though [MARGAERY] speaks well of [RENLY] . lady [OLENNA TYRELL] insists that sansa tell her the truth about what [JOFFREY BARATHEON] is like , as he is to marry [MARGAERY] . sansa is initially reluctant , but when [OLENNA TYRELL] mentions her father , sansa breaks down and , her eyes blazing , angrily recounts how [JOFFREY BARATHEON] had said he would show her father [MERCY] , only to behead him in front of her , and how he then took her up to the [WALL] and forced her to look at her father's head on a spike and claim him providing her father with a swift death was [MERCY] . realizing what she has just been saying , sansa nervously attempts to backtrack . [OLENNA TYRELL] continues to prod sansa as she fidgets around , and it becomes obvious that she is visibly afraid about being overheard . after enough times of [OLENNA TYRELL] insisting that she can trust her not to repeat what she says , sansa blurts out that [JOFFREY BARATHEON] is a monster . [OLENNA TYRELL] is disappointed , but unsurprised , given the rumors that have been circulating about [JOFFREY BARATHEON] ['S] public outbursts . sansa is worried that this means the tyrells will cancel their proposed marriage alliance meaning sansa will be stuck with [JOFFREY BARATHEON] again , but [OLENNA TYRELL] assures her that her son [MACE] is too intent on [MARGAERY] entering into a royal marriage to cancel it for anything . 
shae sneaks into [TYRION] [LANNISTER] ['S] [NEW] chambers . he warns her that his father threatened to [KILL] her if he found her with him again , and that his father follows through on such threats . undeterred , shae starts undressing [TYRION] , and asks him for a favor to protect sansa from [BAELISH] . [TYRION] says that he no longer has enough power or influence to attempt to do that , though shae accuses him of being attracted to sansa , which he cheerfully denies . it also comes out that [TYRION] had sex with ros back in the [NORTH] , though [TYRION] points out it was before he met shae . they playfully bicker about it as they start having sex . 
 [MARGAERY] finds a way to bond with [JOFFREY BARATHEON] . 
 [MARGAERY] is summoned to [JOFFREY BARATHEON] ['S] chambers to see if she needs anything before he leaves on a hunting trip . while [JOFFREY BARATHEON] has previously been easy for [MARGAERY] to manipulate , [CERSEI] was apparently able to plant one seed of doubt in his mind the fact that [MARGAERY] was married to his uncle [RENLY] and thus , already had sex with another [WOMAN] , whom [CERSEI] described as a traitor and known degenerate . when questioned , [MARGAERY] says that she was ordered to marry a traitor as her family duty , but [JOFFREY BARATHEON] implies that this still means he must have had sex with her . [JOFFREY BARATHEON] angrily questions [MARGAERY] about the relationship and she delicately placates him by feigning demure shyness and painting herself as a dutiful , but frustrated , bride . she uses the rumors about [RENLY] ['S] homosexuality to redirect [JOFFREY BARATHEON] ['S] anger , stating that [RENLY] always found excuses to avoid sex , but , in one instance , drunkenly suggested something that sounded very painful and could not possibly result in [CHILDREN] , which draws her [NEW] fiance's sympathy . [MARGAERY] eventually manages to divert attention to the [NEW] custom crossbow [JOFFREY BARATHEON] ['S] had made for his excursion . it quickly becomes apparent that [JOFFREY BARATHEON] is excited by violence and sadism , so she flirts with him by complimenting the crossbow and musing about killing something herself . easily played , [JOFFREY BARATHEON] offers to take her with him to share in the excitement of killing something . 
king [ROBB STARK] settles into the council chamber at [HARRENHAL] with his wife queen [TALISA] . [LORD] [ROOSE BOLTON] interrupts them with [TWO] messenger raven missives , each of which brings bad news . [FIRST] , [ROBB STARK] ['S] maternal grandfather hoster [TULLY] has finally died after a long illness at his [CASTLE] of riverrun . [SECOND] , [ROOSE BOLTON] delivers a letter from his bastard son [RAMSAY SNOW] , stating that the ironborn torched [WINTERFELL] and put all of its inhabitants to the sword , and then fled all before his force arrived there . there has been no sighting of [BRAN] or rickon , and though [ROBB STARK] hopes that they are still alive , there is a strong possibility that they are [DEAD] . moreover , there has been no word of theon , and if he took the boys captive the greyjoys haven't sent out any demands . this double blow reduces [CATELYN STARK] to tears and she laments that she had not seen her father in years . she is horrified at the thought that [BRAN] and rickon were in danger while she was away and could not protect them , and are now likely [DEAD] . 
 [ROBB STARK] leaves [ROOSE BOLTON] in command of [HARRENHAL] with a detachment of the northern army while [ROBB STARK] leads his main host back across the [RIVERLANDS] to riverrun . [LORD] [RICKARD KARSTARK] angrily says that this is a [WASTE] of time , though [ROBB STARK] points out that [CATELYN STARK] ['S] brother and his uncle , edmure [TULLY] , is now [LORD] of riverrun and his levies will reinforce their army . [RICKARD KARSTARK] maintains that unless edmure has been breeding soldiers like rabbits , it will make no difference with their [NEW] [OLENNA TYRELL] allies , the [LANNISTERS] now outnumber them over [TWO] to one . [ROBB STARK] asks if [RICKARD KARSTARK] has lost faith in their cause , and [RICKARD KARSTARK] says he still believes in revenge . however , the fact that [ROBB STARK] lost his [HOME] [CASTLE] makes him seem vulnerable in the eyes of his bannermen , and many no longer believe in [ROBB STARK] as they once did . [LORD] [RICKARD KARSTARK] asks to speak his mind as if he wasn't already , and says that he thinks [ROBB STARK] lost the war the day he married [TALISA] , a political nobody , throwing away any opportunity to forge marriage alliances with badly needed allies , specifically breaking his promise to enter into a marriage alliance with [HOUSE FREY] . 
 [TALISA] notices that [CATELYN STARK] is making a prayer wheel for the faith of the [SEVEN] , and offers to help . [CATELYN STARK] explains that they can only be made by mothers who are praying for the welfare of their [CHILDREN] . [CATELYN STARK] reveals that she has only made them twice before , one of which was when she was praying for [BRAN] to wake from his coma , which worked after a fashion , as he did survive though he lost the use of his legs . [TALISA] asks after the other time , and [CATELYN STARK] says that when they were younger , one of the boys had a pox , and maester [LUWIN] said that if he survived the [NIGHT] he would be all right , but that it would be a long [NIGHT] . [CATELYN STARK] explains that the [BOY] was [JON SNOW] , and at [FIRST] the thought that [JON SNOW] would conveniently [DIE] of natural causes made her inwardly pray to the [SEVEN] for his [END] . however , [CATELYN STARK] then became horrified at herself for thinking such a thing , particularly as [JON SNOW] was an innocent child , and the person [CATELYN STARK] really hated was [JON SNOW] ['S] unidentified [MOTHER] . so she made a prayer wheel and stayed up with him all [NIGHT] , praying to the [GODS] that if they forgave her earlier wish that [JON SNOW] would [DIE] , she promised she would urge [EDDARD] to have [JON SNOW] legitimized as a [CATELYN STARK] and she would raise him as her own son . [JON SNOW] recovered , however , [CATELYN STARK] did not [KEEP] her promise . in grief at the death of her father and apparent death of her [TWO] youngest [SONS] , and her continued grief at losing [EDDARD] , [CATELYN STARK] says the [GODS] are punishing her misconduct with this war . 
not too far away in the [RIVERLANDS] , arya [CATELYN STARK] , [GENDRY] , and hot pie are heading [NORTH] from [HARRENHAL] , planning to eventually reach the [RED] fork of the trident river and then follow it west to her grandfather's [CASTLE] seat at riverrun . off screen , arya explained to the boys how jaqen h'ghar helped them escape because he offered that he would [KILL] any three people she named . [GENDRY] loudly criticizes arya , in disbelief that she used up [TWO] of the names on minor [LANNISTER] guards when she could have said someone like king [JOFFREY] or [TYWIN LANNISTER] and [ENDED] the entire war , at which arya gets quite defensive . however , as they advance in the forest , they run into a scouting party of the [BROTHERHOOD] [WITHOUT] banners , a group of outlaws , whose leader [THOROS] of [MYR] they hear singing the [RAINS] of [CASTAMERE] as they approach . they recognize them as the group the [TYWIN LANNISTER] torturers were asking about at [HARRENHAL] . [THOROS] seems a friendly sort , and they make the [CHILDREN] [COME] with them . they later give them food and drink at a local [INN] . [GENDRY] says he used to work as a smith in king's landing for tobho mott , whom [THOROS] recognizes but says he charged double what the other smiths did [GENDRY] counters that's because it was double the quality . arya insists that she knows how to use a sword despite [THOROS]' disbelief , but when she tries to mock fence with him he quickly disarms her . other members of the [BROTHERHOOD] return to the [INN] with a captive sandor the hound [CLEGANE] . as [THOROS] trades insults with sandor , arya tries to leave , but the hound stops her in astonishment and asks what in [SEVEN] hells they're doing with the [CATELYN STARK] bitch , revealing her identity to all . 
finally , [JAIME] [TYWIN LANNISTER] and brienne of [TARTH] are slowly making their way across country through the [RIVERLANDS] , heading to king's landing intending to make the prisoner exchange for the [CATELYN STARK] girls really , just sansa . [JAIME] continues to mock brienne along the way . brienne is wary enough not to let [JAIME] out of her sight , even insisting on keeping him on his leash and watching while he urinates so he doesn't slip away . [JAIME] deduces that brienne isn't from the [NORTH] because he would have noticed her at [WINTERFELL] when he visited there , so as she is from [HOUSE TARTH] she must be a [BARATHEON] supporter . she angrily denies supporting [STANNIS] , thus confirming that she served [RENLY] . [JAIME] accurately deduces that she fancied [RENLY] , but points out that [RENLY] wasn't attracted to women so much as he was to [LORAS] . brienne says she doesn't want to hear his filthy lies , but he says that he knew [RENLY] better than she did , reminding her that both of them spent the last 17 years living in the [RED KEEP] , ever since [ROBERT] ['S] rebellion when [RENLY] was just a child prancing down the halls . [JAIME] insists that [RENLY] ['S] homosexuality was actually the worst kept secret at court if she thinks he's lying . he continues to casually mock [RENLY] which makes brienne grab him , but he relents and says he doesn't particularly care that [RENLY] loved [LORAS] , as he feels people aren't [FREE] to choose the ones they love which he knows better than most . they [COME] across a farmer with a heavily laden mule , who notices that they're cutting cross country and avoiding the major roads , and suspects that they're avoiding soldiers . [JAIME] tells brienne that he suspects the [MAN] is a scout meant to intercept them , and even if he isn't he can still spread word he saw them . he urges her to [KILL] the [MAN] , but she refuses . 
brienne gives [JAIME] a beatdown . 
later , the pair have to cross a river , which means they can either attempt a dangerous fording or take the bridge , which will probably be watched . brienne takes the safer route of the bridge , but [JAIME] manages to distract her long enough to take away her spare sword and cut his bonds . brienne and [JAIME] enter into an extended sword fight on the bridge . [JAIME] starts off very aggressively , putting brienne on the defensive . however , [JAIME] ['S] mobility is reduced because his hands are still manacled , and he is malnourished after having spent the past full year chained up in a cell . [JAIME] begins to tire , and brienne wears him down further by making body blows with kicks and punches . after a protracted fight [JAIME] finally slumps to the ground in exhaustion . just then , riders from [HOUSE BOLTON] arrive led by a [MAN] named locke . [JAIME] asks if they want to negotiate , but locke says they'll have his head if he doesn't bring the kingslayer back to the king in the [NORTH] , so there's not much [JAIME] can do to dissuade him from taking them prisoner .

in astapor , [DAENERYS] , accompanied by ser [JORAH MORMONT] and ser [BARRISTAN SELMY] , walks along a sea [WALL] known as the [WALK] of [PUNISHMENT] . here , any slave who showed insubordination of any type is strapped to a cross and left to [DIE] out in public , as a warning to all other slaves . [DAENERYS] offers a condemned [MAN] [WATER] , but he refuses to drink , saying he just wants to [DIE] quickly . 
 [JORAH MORMONT] and [BARRISTAN SELMY] continue to disagree on whether or not [DAENERYS] should purchase the [UNSULLIED] . [JORAH MORMONT] insists that it is their only chance to get an army , but [BARRISTAN SELMY] believes this is not the honorable way , as slavery is illegal and abhorred in the [SEVEN KINGDOMS] . [JORAH MORMONT] claims that not only will the slave soldiers be treated better in her service , but innocent people will also be spared in war because the [UNSULLIED] only do as they are ordered . they have no human or masculine urges in their bodies , and therefore will not [KILL] civilians or rape innocent women , unlike most male soldiers who would succumb to those urges in the heat of [BATTLE] . [BARRISTAN SELMY] retorts that when her older brother [RHAEGAR] led his army in the [BATTLE] of the trident , [MEN] fought and died for [RHAEGAR] because they believed in him , because they loved him not because they were slave soldiers whose [FREE FOLK] will had been stripped away . [JORAH MORMONT] responds that [RHAEGAR] indeed fought honorably and nobly , but that in the [END] [RHAEGAR] died . [DAENERYS] was born months after [ROBERT BARATHEON] killed [RHAEGAR] at the [BATTLE] of the trident , and only knew her cruel and half mad brother viserys , so she asks ser [BARRISTAN SELMY] if he knew [RHAEGAR] . [BARRISTAN SELMY] was a member of the [TARGARYEN] [KINGSGUARD] and thus knew [RHAEGAR] well he fought beside him and bled beside him at the trident . [BARRISTAN SELMY] says that [RHAEGAR] was the finest [MAN] he ever met , the last dragon . [DAENERYS] grows quiet and says she wishes she'd known her older brother , but that [RHAEGAR] was not the last dragon she is . 
 [DAENERYS] speaks with kraznys mo nakloz , as he shows her his slave soldiers , the [UNSULLIED] . he repeatedly insults and mocks [DAENERYS] in his native tongue , leaving his slave translator missandei of naath to clean up his crude and very insulting [DARK WORDS] into more respectful language . at one point , she pauses , wondering how to twist a particularly coarse insult from kraznys , and [DAENERYS] notices her reluctance to directly translate . 
 [DAENERYS] says she will take all 8 , 000 [UNSULLIED] soldiers , including those in training . kraznys laughs and retorts that she can barely afford 100 [UNSULLIED] . [DAENERYS] surprises him by telling him she has [DRAGONS] , and is willing to trade one . this offer stops kraznys in his tracks , yet [DAENERYS] repeatedly affirms that he [MAY] only have one of her [DRAGONS] . they strike a deal that she [MAY] have all the [UNSULLIED] soldiers in exchange for her biggest dragon . both [JORAH MORMONT] and [BARRISTAN SELMY] strongly object , and plead to [DAENERYS] that while soldiers are valuable , it is [DRAGONS] that will ultimately [TYWIN LANNISTER] her the [IRON THRONE] . she ignores them , and concludes the deal with kraznys , and also demands missandei as a token of faith . upon leaving the room , she scolds [JORAH MORMONT] and [BARRISTAN SELMY] , telling them that while she values their advice , they should [NEVER] again question her in public . 
 [DAENERYS] speaks with missandei and asks her if she has a family she says no . [DAENERYS] tells her of the [MAN] who turned down her offer of [WATER] , and asks why he would simply say , let me [DIE] . missandei replies that in the afterlife , there is no master . thus , the [MAN] would rather be [DEAD] than alive in the slavers bay . [DAENERYS] proceeds to explain the dangers missandei will be facing in [DAENERYS] ['S] service and asks if that will be a problem . missandei simply replies , [VALAR MORGHULIS] all [MEN] must [DIE] . [DAENERYS] acknowledges the truth of the [DARK WORDS] , but quips , we are not [MEN] . .

[JON SNOW] says that there were three hundred [MEN] of the [NIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] at the [FIST] , and asks mance if [JORAH MORMONT] could still be alive . mance says that with [JORAH MORMONT] , it's possible he was able to escape , but that even if he did he and his [MEN] took quite a beating and are trapped miles away from the [WALL] with the [WHITE] walkers in close pursuit . mance warns [JON SNOW] that all of the missing corpses from the [FIST] are no longer his friends and brothers from the [NIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] , but have been resurrected as undead monsters who serve the [WHITE] walkers . 
mance orders tormund to take a force of twenty [MEN] to scale the [WALL] to attack [CASTLE BLACK] from its exposed rear . the fortresses of the [NIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] were purposefully built to only defend from attack over the [WALL] , [WITHOUT] defenses on their southern sides , so they wouldn't be a threat to the lords of the [SEVEN KINGDOMS] . mance's plan is for tormund's small band to distract [CASTLE BLACK] by attacking their exposed southern side , at which point mance's main army will assault it from the [NORTH] . tormund will know that mance is in position when his army makes a massive signal [FIRE] mance boasts that i'm going to make the biggest [FIRE] the [NORTH] has ever seen mance orders tormund to take [JON SNOW] with him , as [JON SNOW] knows the layout of [CASTLE BLACK] , and it will prove a key test of his loyalty if it turns out that he won't really betray the [NIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] , tormund can easily throw him off the [WALL] to his death .

[JEOR MORMONT] tensely questions craster's claim to be a godly [MAN] , but craster insists that he is to the real [GODS] , the [WHITE] walkers , who consume entire armies on their way to the [WALL] but will spare craster for his loyalty . he admits that he's feeding his pigs better than them as pigs are valuable to him and half seriously suggests to his guests that they should eat the fat samwell tarly . he is also annoyed by gilly's loud wailing from birthing pains . [SAM] leaves the main [HOUSE] to a birthing hut where he witnesses gilly giving birth with the aid of a few other women . to her horror , the baby is a [BOY] .

brynden takes aim . 
at riverrun in the [RIVERLANDS] , the [CASTLE BLACK] seat of [HOUSE TULLY] , the funeral of the recently deceased [LORD] hoster [HOUSE TULLY] is held on the banks of the [RED] fork of the trident river . king [ROBB STARK] has arrived with the main force of the northern army , and he helps launch his maternal grandfather's funeral boat , along with hoster's younger brother brynden the blackfish [HOUSE TULLY] . [CATELYN] and [ROBB STARK] ['S] [NEW] wife queen [TALISA] look on with the assembled crowd of bannermen on the dock . hoster's youngest child , [CATELYN] ['S] younger brother edmure [HOUSE TULLY] , attempts to light the funeral boat on [FIRE] with a flaming arrow but fails three times . just as the boat is about to disappear around a bend of the river , brynden pushes his nephew out of the way and skillfully makes the shot . knowing his accuracy was true and the shot would hit the boat , the blackfish turns around to [WALK] away dismissively showing up edmure at the same time as soon as he releases the arrow . 
in [CATELYN] ['S] [OLD] chamber in the [CASTLE BLACK] , she mourns with her uncle brynden over her father's death . she asks him if he made peace with his older brother , with whom he had been fighting for the past thirty years . brynden explains that he did on his deathbed hoster told him to stop calling himself the blackfish as it was a stupid joke created over thirty years ago by brynden to symbolize his bad relationship with his older brother , and it wasn't very funny to begin with . brynden emotionally joked back to his dying brother that people had been calling him blackfish for so long that they'd practically forgotten his real [NAME] . [CATELYN] is happy that her uncle was able to make peace with her father before he passed , and is upset that she couldn't have been there . she reminisces that she watched from this window in her childhood whenever her father left , but now he won't be [COMING] back . she tearfully wonders if her [SONS] [BRAN] and rickon similarly watched at [WINTERFELL] for her return when she failed to arrive to save them . brynden insists that neither he nor [ROBB STARK] have given up hope that the boys [MAY] be alive and in hiding , and urges her to be strong for [ROBB STARK] . 
 [TYRION] is fascinated at pod's ability to pleasure women . 
king [ROBB STARK] , brynden , and edmure confer in riverrun's meeting room . the war is not going well for them . the [LANNISTERS] have defeated their enemies in the south and secured king's landing from attack , as well as a marriage alliance with [HOUSE TYRELL] . they have superior numbers , wealth , and strategic position . edmure begins to speak of his recent victory at the [BATTLE] of stone mill , which pushed the [LANNISTER] army under ser [GREGOR CLEGANE] from the [RIVERLANDS] . [ROBB STARK] and brynden , however , are furious with edmure their grand strategy was to lure [TYWIN] and [GREGOR CLEGANE] ['S] armies into the westerlands , where they would be vulnerable , out of position , and unable to defend the capital against the baratheons . edmure's role in this was to offer token defense as a feint to lure the [LANNISTERS] back west across the [RED] fork of the trident . instead , by successfully attacking the [LANNISTERS] at stone mill , edmure kept them penned in the [RIVERLANDS] , and thus close enough to king's landing that [TYWIN] was able to rush to the defense of the city at the [BATTLE] of the [BLACKWATER] . the [STARKS]' strategic position in the war has been ruined . edmure insists that they took valuable captives in the [BATTLE] , willem and martyn [LANNISTER] , but [ROBB STARK] angrily points out that he didn't stop fighting because his sisters are held captive . considering that [TYWIN] didn't stop to negotiate when his own eldest son was captured , taking his younger nephews hostage will have no impact on the war . edmure tries to at least point out that they lost only [TWO] hundred [MEN] at stone mill and multiple [LANNISTER] soldiers died for every [MAN] they lost , at which [ROBB STARK] cuts him off and shouts that they need their [MEN] more than [TYWIN LANNISTER] needs his who already outnumber the [STARKS] significantly . at this point , the [LANNISTERS] are in such a good strategic position that they can afford to be patient , and grind down [ROBB STARK] ['S] forces through simple attrition . 
in the prison cells at riverrun , queen [TALISA] bandages the minor wounds of willem and martyn [TYWIN LANNISTER] . they are boys , only 14 and 15 years [OLD] . one of them asks if [ROBB STARK] really transforms into a [WOLF] eats the flesh of his enemies . [TALISA] says yes but that he does not eat the flesh of [CHILDREN] , except during the full moon . she asks a guard if it's currently a full moon , and reassures the now terrified child that he is safe . 
 [WOLF] bread . 
at king's landing , [TYWIN LANNISTER] calls the [FIRST] meeting of the small council since he arrived in the city and assumed his position as [HAND] of the king . he has the meeting place changed to a room next to his own quarters in the [TOWER] of the [HAND] , asserting his dominance . [TYWIN LANNISTER] arrives early and has all of the council members called in at once . all of the seats are on one side of the table , as a non verbal test to see how each of them reacts around him . petyr [BAELISH] ambitiously pushes his way past everyone else to be the one who sits closest to [TYWIN LANNISTER] . [VARYS] rolls his eyes at littlefinger's naked ambition and lets him pass , content to sit in the [SECOND] closest seat for now . grand maester [PYCELLE] , who is most focused on survival by avoiding direct conflict , doesn't try to fight over a better seat with either of them , instead quietly taking the third seat away from [TYWIN LANNISTER] . [TYWIN LANNISTER] ['S] daughter [CERSEI] arrives to find the seats are all occupied , but not wanting to play that [GAME] and be relegated to a lowly position , she pulls up a chair so she is sitting at [TYWIN LANNISTER] ['S] right [HAND] , opposite littlefinger . [TYRION] is the only one who even mildly stands up to [TYWIN LANNISTER] ['S] posturing , by not even trying to sit closest to [TYWIN LANNISTER] instead he takes a [NEW] chair and makes a point of noisily dragging it across the ground until it is positioned at the exact opposite [END] of the table from his father . 
 [TYWIN LANNISTER] is upset with the three advisors , noting that between them , they possess the greatest number of spies in the world , yet none of them can locate his son [JAIME] , even though the entire northern army has heard of his escape . [TYWIN LANNISTER] asks what news there is of the war , and [VARYS] reports that [ROBB STARK] has taken the bulk of his army to riverrun for his grandfather's funeral , while leaving [LORD] [ROOSE BOLTON] in command of [HARRENHAL] . [VARYS] makes a jab at littlefinger's recent , titular promotion as [LORD] of [HARRENHAL] , noting that this makes [ROOSE BOLTON] the current [LORD] of [HARRENHAL] in practice if not in [NAME] . however , [TYWIN LANNISTER] says that [ROOSE BOLTON] can [KEEP] it , because the title alone is enough to give littlefinger the social standing to be a suitor to lady [LYSA ARRYN] . littlefinger states that they have known each other since childhood , and [LYSA ARRYN] has always adored him , and thus she will soon remarry to him . [PYCELLE] notes that this will make littlefinger the acting [LORD] paramount of the [VALE] , an even more important position [BAELISH] is even wearing a more expensive tunic than usual , laced with gold , to reflect his [NEW] status . . 
theon is nearly raped by his torturer . 
 [TYWIN LANNISTER] states that this will confirm that the [VALE] of [LYSA ARRYN] , which has been neutral in the war up to now , will not support [ROBB STARK] , who is increasingly being hemmed in by enemies other marriage alliances , with [HOUSE TYRELL] of the reach and [HOUSE MARTELL] of dorne , combined with the crushing of the baratheons , have in turn secured the rest of southern westeros under [TYWIN LANNISTER] control . [TYRION] points out that if [BAELISH] departs for the [VALE] that leaves a vacancy on the small council , and [TYWIN LANNISTER] reveals that he has appointed [TYRION] as the [NEW] master of coin to replace him . while this [MAY] seem like giving [TYRION] a position of relative power again , [TYRION] quickly points out that he has no prior experience in finance . with backhanded compliments , [CERSEI] makes it clear that this promotion is really intended to give him an opportunity to make mistakes he will be blamed for . 
after the meeting , [TYRION] , podrick [PAYNE] , and ser [BRONN] drop by littlefinger's office in his brothel , where he keeps his ledgers . pod loads them all into a cart as ros flirts with him . littlefinger says it was the safest place to [KEEP] such records , but [TYRION] notes that his brothel hasn't been the safest place for [BASTARDS] . [BAELISH] says he hopes [TYRION] does well in the position , as he owes him for securing the release of ros after [CERSEI] arrested her , mistaking her for shae but [TYRION] says it was just a misunderstanding . [TYRION] and [BRONN] then lead pod into another room of the brothel , where [TYRION] says that he wants to reward him for saving his life during the [BATTLE] of the [BLACKWATER] he has paid for podrick who has [NEVER] had sex with a [WOMAN] to enjoy the services of not one , but three prostitutes marei , genna , and a contortionist named kayla one of only four women in the world who can properly perform a meereenese knot . 
later , [TYRION] is reading through the financial records , and explains to [BRONN] that not all is as [BAELISH] would like the court to think . [BRONN] asks if he thinks littlefinger has been stealing to obtain the [CROWN] ['S] money , but [TYRION] says the problem is more that he's been borrowing all of it . littlefinger always acted like he was a financial genius who could raise money seemingly out of nowhere , but in reality the [IRON THRONE] is heavily in debt , and littlefinger procured enough money to balance the books every year by borrowing massive sums of money from foreign banks . . 
brienne is beaten down as the captors prepare to rape her . 
in particular , much of their debt is owed to the [IRON THRONE] bank of braavos , the largest bank in the [FREE] cities . [TYRION] warns [BRONN] that when debtors to the [IRON THRONE] bank can not repay their loans , the [IRON THRONE] bank will [FIRST] refuse to give out [NEW] loans , and ultimately support rebellions against them . [TYRION] fears that if they can't repay the debt , the [IRON THRONE] bank will eventually cut them off and start supporting [ROBB STARK] or [STANNIS BARATHEON] . podrick then returns , with the money [TYRION] gave him to pay the prostitutes . [TYRION] is concerned that he lost heart and fled , but pod innocently says he did all sorts of [THINGS] with the prostitutes they simply refused his offer of payment . impressed that the women would provide their services for [FREE] , [TYRION] and [BRONN] ask pod to explain in detail what transpired , so they can take copious notes . 
at dragonstone , king [STANNIS BARATHEON] speaks with melisandre as she prepares to depart by boat . he is worried that his enemies think he is defeated and are laughing at him , and that now even she is abandoning him . she assures him that she still thinks he is the [LORD] ['S] chosen , but she must travel to the [RIVERLANDS] to obtain something vital for his cause . [STANNIS BARATHEON] says that he wants her , and that he wants [JOFFREY] and [ROBB STARK] [DEAD] , and asks her to make a son again with him like the shadow creature she conjured to assassinate [RENLY] . melisandre says that she can not creating a shadow creature drains some of the [FIRE] of a [WOMAN] ['S] life force , and she fears that creating another would [KILL] [STANNIS BARATHEON] . over his protests , she explains that what she is seeking is even more powerful than a shadow creature , and will change his fortunes in this war , but she needs a king's [BLOOD] to do it . [STANNIS BARATHEON] doesn't understand , but melisandre implies that she needs to burn a human sacrifice who possesses a king's [BLOOD] as an offering to the [LORD] of light . she can't [KILL] [STANNIS BARATHEON] himself to achieve this , but as she points out , there are others with your [BLOOD] in their veins any of his brother king [ROBERT] ['S] bastard [CHILDREN] who managed to survive the purge . 
at the [INN] at the [CROSSROADS] in the [RIVERLANDS] , arya [ROBB STARK] , [GENDRY] , and hot pie are still in the company of the [BROTHERHOOD] [WITHOUT] banners , who are preparing to depart . [GENDRY] has finished fixing a steel breastplate which [THOROS] puts on , and arya asks why [GENDRY] is helping them . [THOROS] says that they're not prisoners , it's just that the war torn [RIVERLANDS] aren't a safe place for ned [ROBB STARK] ['S] daughter . arya notices that they are loading sandor the hound [CLEGANE] into a prisoner cart , so she walks over and angrily asks him if he [REMEMBERS] the last time he was here , but he simply says all poor inns look the same . . 
 [JAIME] loses his sword [HAND] . 
as they get ready to leave , hot pie explains that he isn't going with them he baked some bread for the innkeeper , and as he was a baker's apprentice when he lived in king's landing , the innkeeper thought it was the best bread they'd ever had , and offered him a job . this life of fighting and travelling isn't really for him , plus [THOROS] formally made a deal with the innkeeper to pay for the [FREE] meals they enjoyed with hot pie's services . before they go , he gives arya a present he made for her a loaf of bread shaped like a direwolf , though arya implies the tail looks like a head . arya is a bit brusque but the three wish each other well as they depart , and as they are riding away arya starts eating the [WOLF] bread , and turns back to shout to hot pie that it is very good . 
at an undisclosed location , theon [GREYJOY] escapes from the dungeon with the help of a young [WOMAN] , who gives him a horse and tells him to ride east . theon thanks him and says he'll make him a [LORD] of the [IRON ISLANDS] for this , but the [BOY] says that they aren't in the [IRON ISLANDS] now . theon is later hunted down by his captors in a prolonged chase on horseback through the woods . ultimately his pursuers split into [TWO] groups and trap theon between them , and he is knocked off his horse with a flail . theon's captors pin him to the ground , and pull down his pants the leader declares that he intends to rape theon as [PUNISHMENT] for trying to run away . however , theon's unidentified savior returns and snipes all of the captors from afar using his bow , rescuing him at the last minute . 
somewhere else in the [RIVERLANDS] , [JAIME] [LANNISTER] and brienne of [TARTH] have been taken captive by locke and a detachment of [MEN] from [HOUSE BOLTON] . as they ride along , the [MEN] sing a rousing chorus of the [BEAR] and the [MAIDEN FAIR] . tied up back to back on one of the horses , [JAIME] warns brienne that when they make camp for the [NIGHT] , they will rape her , more than once , and that his honest advice is to give no resistance , and just think of [RENLY] . they were only sent to capture [JAIME] , therefore brienne means nothing to them , so at the slightest provocation they will [KILL] her [WITHOUT] hesitation . brienne says she will fight even if they [KILL] her , and [JAIME] agrees that if he were a [WOMAN] , he would fight to the death before being raped , too . 
later that [NIGHT] locke's [MEN] make camp , and do indeed drag brienne kicking and screaming into the bushes to gang rape her . [JAIME] is disgusted by this pointless brutality , so he points out to locke that brienne is actually a noblewoman and the sole heir of [LORD] [SELWYN] of [TARTH] , the sapphire isle , and her father will pay them a ransom of her weight in sapphires provided that she is unharmed . locke agrees and calls his [MEN] back before they are able to rape brienne , and they tie her up to a tree again . [JAIME] tries to smooth talk locke once again with offers of how his father [TYWIN] will make him extravagantly rich if he lets [JAIME] go . tiring of [JAIME] ['S] frequent attempts to bribe him into turning over to the [LANNISTER] side , locke decides to prove that [JAIME] ['S] father will [NEVER] deal with the likes of him . at [FIRST] locke has his [MEN] untie [JAIME] on the pretext of letting him go , but then his [MEN] hold him down on a chopping block while locke grabs a carving knife , threatening to stab [JAIME] in the eye . locke reasons that maiming [TYWIN] ['S] son will be the ultimate proof that the [LANNISTERS] would [NEVER] deal with locke , much less bribe him . locke says that [JAIME] ['S] father can't help him now , and this should help you remember as he swings down the carving knife and hacks off [JAIME] ['S] sword [HAND] . for half a [SECOND] , [JAIME] stares at his severed right [HAND] in shock , before what just happened can register in his mind and then he begins to scream in horror .

in the [RIVERLANDS] , [JAIME] [LANNISTER] has had his sword [HAND] cut off by locke . the following day , locke's [MEN] lead their prisoners [JAIME] and brienne of [TARTH] back to [HARRENHAL] on horseback . locke is gaining maximum enjoyment from torturing someone who can't possibly fight back he ties [JAIME] ['S] severed right [HAND] onto a rope and hangs it around [JAIME] ['S] [NECK] , forcing [JAIME] to smell as the flesh of his own [HAND] rots . [JAIME] is physically in agony from his wound , feverish and half delirious . [JAIME] can barely stay conscious , and he falls headlong off of his horse into the mud . locke has been tormenting [JAIME] by not giving him [WATER] and he is almost dying of thirst . one of locke's [MEN] moves to give him [WATER] but instead empties the canteen over [JAIME] ['S] head to taunt him . [JAIME] weakly tries to point out that if he actually dies locke and his [MEN] will be in serious trouble , but locke simply dismisses this . locke then hands him a container , which he desperately guzzles down rapidly , too weak to notice what it is . locke then points out that he filled the container with horse piss just to torment [JAIME] , who spits out what he can . [JAIME] can barely move , but locke viciously kicks him repeatedly . in a surge of effort [JAIME] manages to steal the sword from one of locke's [MEN] , but [JAIME] is so weak and feverish that he can barely stand , much less wield a sword and he can not fight as well with his left [HAND] as he could his sword [HAND] . [JAIME] soon realizes this , and actually isn't trying to fight them off any more , but instead to provoke one of them to [KILL] him so he doesn't have to go on living like this and can [DIE] with the small dignity of having a sword in his [HAND] . he succumbs to exhaustion and locke doesn't even bother to punish him this time , just warning him that if he tries that again he'll cut off his other [HAND] . 
later that [NIGHT] [JAIME] and brienne are restrained near a campfire . [JAIME] refuses to eat , and says he wants to [DIE] . brienne says he should try to live for revenge , but [JAIME] says he was that [HAND] , and [WITHOUT] his sword [HAND] , even if he escapes , he is nothing , and would rather [DIE] as the [JAIME] he was than go on living , robbed of his very identity . brienne grows angry , insinuating to [JAIME] that this is the [FIRST] time he's had to face the real world where [THINGS] people care about get taken away , but he's pathetically moping around like a [WOMAN] . her criticism and strength convinces [JAIME] to start eating . brienne says she overheard when he earlier managed to talk locke out of letting his [MEN] gang rape her , by convincing him that her father will pay locke her weight in sapphires . while brienne is a noblewoman and worth a ransom , [TARTH] is called the sapphire isle due to the color of the seas around it , not because there are any actual sapphires , and [HOUSE TARTH] is not particularly rich . brienne is completely confused , and asks [JAIME] why he helped her , but he doesn't answer . 
 [VARYS]' long awaited revenge . 
in king's landing , [TYRION] [LANNISTER] meets with [VARYS] , who is in the middle of prying open a large wooden crate . [TYRION] asks [VARYS] to help him confirm who sent ser [MANDON MOORE] to [KILL] him during the [BATTLE] of the [BLACKWATER] . [VARYS] says he would like to help , but the most he has are whispers that it was [CERSEI] , but only whispers , and he can not confirm who gave the order . [TYRION] wants to know with certainty if it was his sister so he can take revenge . [VARYS] uses this opportunity to finish a conversation they were having on the eve of the [BATTLE] , in which [VARYS] promised to reveal how he was castrated . [VARYS] says that he used to be a slave in a travelling troupe that passed through all of the [FREE] cities , but once when he was in [MYR] he was sold to a sorcerer . the sorcerer gave him a potion which temporarily paralyzed him while still leaving him fully aware and able to experience pain , and then he cut his genitals off , root and stem shaft and testes . the sorcerer needed his genitals as a sacrifice for a spell , and he burned [VARYS]' genitals in a brazier of [FIRE] . what [VARYS] has had recurrent nightmares about to this day is not the sorcerer , or the knife , or the pain ... but that when the sorcerer prayed to the blue flames in his ceremony , a voice clearly answered him from the flames . whether it was a god or a demon or simply parlor tricks , [VARYS] [NEVER] knew , as the sorcerer threw him out into the street to [DIE] . but he was determined to live , to spite the sorcerer , and one day get his revenge on him . [VARYS] did whatever it took to claw his way up into a position of influence in the world [FIRST] , to survive he would beg , steal , or sell the sexual use of the parts of his body he still had . increasingly , he discovered that stealing [MEN] ['S] secrets was far more profitable than anything physical which could be stolen , and in time , he worked his way up from the slums of [MYR] to the small council in king's landing . this is why [VARYS] has always hated those who claim to wield magical powers , and particularly why he opposed [STANNIS BARATHEON] , who relies on the [RED] priestess melisandre . as [VARYS] finishes his long tale , he finally finishes prying the last nail out of the crate and opens it . to [TYRION] ['S] astonishment , it contains an elderly sorcerer , the very same one that castrated [VARYS] so many years ago . he is still alive but gagged , and was shipped to [VARYS] in the crate . using his own life as an example , [VARYS] thus urges [TYRION] to be patient , and his revenge will [COME] to him in time . [VARYS] then closes the crate , with the sorcerer still inside . 
 [VARYS] visits ros , who has been secretly spying on littlefinger for him . he is surprised to hear her report from the other prostitutes in the brothel on the prodigious activities of one podrick [PAYNE] . [VARYS] is perplexed as to what exactly happened ros says the girls told her he wasn't particularly large or anything , so much as what he did , but when she repeatedly asked them what exactly that was , the most they could say is that it was hard to describe . she then reports on how frequently littlefinger has visited sansa [STARK] , and says she thinks he is obsessed with her , and wants to smuggle her out of the city . he asks why she thinks this is true , and she presents a stolen copy of the ship's manifest for the boat that will take littlefinger to the [VALE] . [VARYS] is surprised that ros is literate and asks what obvious point it is that he doesn't see . she points out that there will be [TWO] feather beds , and [VARYS] realizes littlefinger would only pay the extra money for someone other than littlefinger if it was sansa . 
 [CERSEI] and [OLENNA] in the [GREAT SEPT] of [BAELOR] . [JOFFREY] and [MARGAERY] wave at the pleased crowd . [JOFFREY] gives [MARGAERY] a tour of the [GREAT SEPT] of [BAELOR] , where their royal [WEDDING] is to be held , as [CERSEI] [LANNISTER] and [OLENNA TYRELL] follow . [JOFFREY] excitedly relates tales of the darker chapters of the [GREAT SEPT] ['S] history , to [MARGAERY] ['S] feigned interest and [CERSEI] ['S] annoyance . [OLENNA TYRELL] asks if [ROBERT BARATHEON] was buried with the [TARGARYEN] kings in the [GREAT SEPT] [CERSEI] explains that he left instructions to return his remains to storm's [END] . when [CERSEI] dismisses the accident that claimed [ROBERT BARATHEON] ['S] life , [OLENNA TYRELL] laments her son's total lack of military prowess . [CERSEI] points out that [OLENNA TYRELL] ['S] son [LORD] [MACE] [OLENNA TYRELL] besieged storm's [END] for almost a full year during [ROBERT BARATHEON] ['S] rebellion , but [OLENNA TYRELL] scoffs that her oaf of a son is no warrior and the only thing he laid siege to was the banquet table in the command tent . [OLENNA TYRELL] muses on the shortcomings of the [MEN] in their lives and the arrangement of patriarchy in general , to which [CERSEI] wistfully says that it is the will of the [GODS] . thus distracted , [MARGAERY] convinces [JOFFREY] to greet the crowd outside . having been somewhat placated by [MARGAERY] ['S] charity , the crowd happily cheers for the pair of them . [CERSEI] realizes she has lost control of [JOFFREY] to the tyrells . 
subsequently , [CERSEI] meets with her father [TYWIN] in his chambers . she wants to ensure that he is doing everything he can to find [JAIME] . [TYWIN] dismissively points out that he started a war when his hated dwarf son [TYRION] was captured by the [STARKS] , so assuredly he is willing to do even more now for his elder son . [TYWIN] makes it clear that he considers [JAIME] his heir despite the fact that as a [KINGSGUARD] member , [JAIME] has officially renounced all rights to inheritance . [TYRION] previously noted that he is next in line of succession after [JAIME] , as a younger son inherits before an older daughter , but [TYWIN] said he would [NEVER] let his hated dwarf son be his heir . [CERSEI] points out that as she is next in line of succession maybe [TYWIN] should consider her the real heir to his legacy , not his [SONS] . she claims she is the only one of his [CHILDREN] who ever took his lectures on family and legacy seriously . she points out that for a [MAN] who pays a lot of lip service to family and legacy , he excludes her from his plans . [TYWIN] confirms that he excludes [CERSEI] from his plans , but not because she is a [WOMAN] he distrusts her because she isn't nearly as smart as she thinks she is . he sneers that she has allowed [JOFFREY] to run roughshod over her , the city and its people , and that he intends to rein in his grandson's deranged behavior . [CERSEI] says she is afraid of the growing influence of the tyrells at court , and something must be done about them . in particular , [CERSEI] is nervous about how skilled [MARGAERY] [OLENNA TYRELL] is at manipulating [JOFFREY] . [TYWIN] bluntly responds that it's good someone has finally been able to manipulate [JOFFREY] , as [CERSEI] herself has clearly proven to be incapable of doing it . she says [TYWIN] should try stopping [JOFFREY] from doing what he likes implying he will find it extremely difficult , but her father firmly responds , i will . . 
 [VARYS] and [OLENNA TYRELL] discuss sansa meanwhile , [OLENNA TYRELL] is seated in the [GARDENS] with [TWO] of [MARGAERY] ['S] cousins . one of them embroiders a [GOLDEN] [OLENNA TYRELL] [ROSE] with their motto , growing strong , which prompts [OLENNA TYRELL] to complain that their family has the dullest sigil and motto in the [SEVEN KINGDOMS] . other families have interesting mottos like [WINTER] is [COMING] or we do not sow , and have direwolves and krakens for sigils . [VARYS] arrives to meet with [OLENNA TYRELL] and she shoos the girls away . they [WALK] through the [GARDENS] , and while [OLENNA TYRELL] remains relatively polite she instantly sees through all of [VARYS]' pleasantries . [VARYS] is verbally outmatched , for once , and she asks him to just get to the point . he says that he is extremely worried that littlefinger is going to try to take control of sansa [STARK] with [ROBB STARK] ['S] younger brothers presumed [DEAD] at [WINTERFELL] , and arya [ROBB STARK] missing and presumed [DEAD] for over a year , sansa is [ROBB STARK] ['S] only heir . the war of the five kings is not going well for the [STARKS] now , and if [ROBB STARK] were to be defeated and [DIE] , the [WOMAN] who controls sansa controls the [NORTH] . [VARYS] says that while he enjoys sparring with [BAELISH] , he is truly horrified by the [WOMAN] . while they are all engaged in the intrigues and murders of court politics , [BAELISH] has utterly no limits on what he will do to achieve power he would burn the entire realm down if it meant he could be king of the ashes . [OLENNA TYRELL] agrees and says that the solution is rather obvious . 
shortly thereafter , [MARGAERY] [OLENNA TYRELL] finds sansa [ROBB STARK] praying in the [RED KEEP] ['S] godswood , overlooking [BLACKWATER] bay . she dismisses the [LANNISTER] guards threatening to tell the king they refused her if they don't leave and engages in pleasant small talk . [MARGAERY] plays a small joke on sansa by saying that her cousin died of a pox which made her face melt off , but is just trying to brighten her spirits though in the process is reminded that sansa is still somewhat na ve . [MARGAERY] then invites sansa to visit highgarden in the reach someday . sansa is confused , as queen [CERSEI] won't allow her to leave the city , but [MARGAERY] wryly points out that queen regent [CERSEI] might not want her to , but queen [MARGAERY] would be happy to share highgarden's pageantry with a friend ... or a sister . [MARGAERY] points out that if sansa were to marry [LORAS] , then she would belong in highgarden anyway . the thought of finally escaping [JOFFREY] , being wed to her idol and becoming a [OLENNA TYRELL] makes sansa choke out tears of joy . 
the hound is brought before the [BROTHERHOOD] to answer for his crimes . elsewhere in the [RIVERLANDS] , arya [ROBB STARK] and [GENDRY] are kept hooded as [THOROS] of [MYR] and his [MEN] lead them into a cave , hollow hill , which serves as the secret hideout of the [BROTHERHOOD] [WITHOUT] banners . sandor the hound [CLEGANE] is brought with them in restraints , and is confronted by the leader of the [BROTHERHOOD] , ser [BERIC] dondarrion . ser [BERIC] was commanded by none other than [EDDARD STARK] to lead a group of soldiers to track down and bring to justice the false [KNIGHT] ser [GREGOR CLEGANE] , when he started raiding the [RIVERLANDS] under [TYWIN LANNISTER] ['S] orders at the very beginning of the war of the five kings . they subsequently became trapped behind [TYWIN LANNISTER] lines , but continued to harass their forces by forming the [BROTHERHOOD] . over time , however , they began to realize how much suffering was being inflicted on the smallfolk of the [RIVERLANDS] by [EDDARD STARK] and [TYWIN LANNISTER] forces alike , and began to defend the commoners from raiders from both sides of the war . over time they were joined by [EDDARD STARK] deserters , [BARATHEON] deserters , and commoners who want to defend their homes . 
dondarrion says he's still following the mission that [EDDARD STARK] set him on , to bring [GREGOR CLEGANE] to justice and restore king [ROBERT] ['S] peace to the [RIVERLANDS] . the hound balks that [EDDARD STARK] and [ROBERT] are [DEAD] now , and he can't just be fighting for ghosts , but dondarrion says that now the [BROTHERHOOD] are ghosts , attacking the [LANNISTERS] where they least expect them , melting away back to their hideouts in the woods . the [BROTHERHOOD] points out that the [TYWIN LANNISTER] lions have been butchering the innocent . at the outbreak of the war , dondarrion's group were ambushed in the [BATTLE] at the mummer's ford , where girls as young as [SEVEN KINGDOMS] were raped and babies were cut in half in front of their parents . sandor points out that he wasn't at mummer's ford . the [BROTHERHOOD] continues to cite various [TYWIN LANNISTER] crimes [THOROS] says he was there during the sack of king's landing and saw the butchered corpses of the royal [CHILDREN] , rhaenys and aegon [TARGARYEN] . sandor continues to point out that he wasn't present for these crimes and many of them were in fact committed by his older brother [GREGOR CLEGANE] who personally killed the baby aegon , then raped and killed his [MOTHER] elia . sandor says that they can't [KILL] him for the crime of being born into [HOUSE CLEGANE] and being related to [GREGOR CLEGANE] . he also scoffs at how dondarrion and many of his [MEN] have converted to the [LORD] of light religion , of which [THOROS] is a priest . arya then speaks up , and angrily accuses sandor of killing her friend mycah , the butcher's [BOY] , then slinging his corpse over his horse like a deer . sandor matter of factly admits that he killed mycah , but says he was in no place to question then [PRINCE] [JOFFREY] ['S] orders . the [BROTHERHOOD] , closing in on something sandor actually did , charge him with the crime of following orders to [KILL] mycah , but that they will give him a [FAIR] trial dondarrion himself will face sandor in a trial by combat .

in the [NORTH] , [BRAN] [EDDARD STARK] is having a shared greensight dream with jojen [REED] . they are walking through the woods and see the three eyed raven again . jojen advises [BRAN] that he must follow the raven , and when he is confused , jojen points out that he must follow it by climbing a tree . [BRAN] begins to [CLIMB] the tree that the raven has landed in but he soon becomes terrified , remembering the fall that crippled him when he was climbing a [TOWER] at [WINTERFELL] . he sees a vivid dream memory of his [MOTHER] [CATELYN] , repeating her warning in which she made him promise [NEVER] to [CLIMB] again a promise which he broke , and thus indirectly led to the fall which crippled him . [BRAN] is so terrified of the memory of [CATELYN] yelling at him that he falls off the tree . [BRAN] and jojen wake in their camp in the woods , disappointed that he could not follow the three eyed raven . 
elsewhere , apparently in the [NORTH] , theon [GREYJOY] is being led by the [BOY] who set him [FREE] from the dungeon and then rescued him by killing his captors when they tried to recapture him . he says that he is leading theon to deepwood motte , a [CASTLE] on the west coast of the [NORTH] which was captured by his sister yara . he says he is concerned that some of the guards [MAY] betray theon , so it is best to sneak into the [CASTLE] through the drains until they reach his sister in person . as the [BOY] fumbles around with keys at a locked gate , theon sinks to the ground and asks if his father [BALON] knows he was taken captive the [BOY] says he doesn't know but theon says he probably did but left him for [DEAD] . filled with remorse , theon laments that his real father died when his head was cut off in king's landing , that he had a choice between [TWO] families , and he chose wrong . theon says that now , he has destroyed everything he ever cared about , and his real [HOME] [WINTERFELL] is burned to the ground . he also says the only thing he ever resented about [ROBB STARK] is that [ROBB STARK] could effortlessly be the kind of good [MAN] that theon truly wanted to be but had to struggle against his own failings to be like . theon even apologizes aloud for having [TWO] innocent orphan boys killed , so in desperation he could pass them off as [BRAN] and rickon [ROBB STARK] . the [BOY] is surprised , and theon explains to him that [BRAN] and rickon escaped , so he had to fake their deaths so he wouldn't seem weak . 
the [BOY] leads theon into a [DARK] chamber in the [CASTLE] , and he calls out for yara . the [BOY] then lights a torch ... revealing the same x shaped cross that theon was chained to when he was being tortured before . theon was led in a complete circle , back to the very same dungeon he escaped from in the [FIRST] place . other guards [COME] in and the [BOY] shouts to tie theon up again , where he belongs , and that it was theon who killed the other guards when he tried to escape instead of him . the [BOY] , giving commands , is revealed to be one of the head torturers , and theon's entire escape that he led him on was nothing more than another form of torture , sadistically toying with him .

at craster's [KEEP] , tensions run [HIGH] among the members of the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] who sought shelter there after escaping the devastating defeat at the [BATTLE] of the [FIST] of the [FIRST] [MEN] . grenn and edd are shoveling pig shit , but the former rapist rast urges them that they are not safe here and can not trust craster the [MAN] sacrifices his own newborn [SONS] to the [WHITE] walkers , and there's every probability that if the [WHITE] walkers do [COME] , he'll [HAND] over the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] survivors to his real masters . grenn and edd don't want to discuss it . 
samwell tarly visits gilly , who is deeply distraught about the fate of her newborn son . she is frantic , and yells at [SAM] not to draw attention to the fact that it's a [BOY] by calling it a he so loud , as craster will want to offer it up as a sacrifice when he finds out it's a son . he asks her if she's decided on a [NAME] , but she responds that there's no point in naming her baby if he's only going to be offered up as a human sacrifice . she gives [SAM] back his [MOTHER] ['S] thimble and says she doesn't care about such stupid [THINGS] , all she's focused on is protecting the life of her baby . 
some of their wounded have died from their injuries , and [LORD] commander [JEOR MORMONT] leads a funeral service as they burn the corpse of a [MAN] named bannen on a pyre . [JEOR MORMONT] didn't know the [MAN] well , but he rode bravely into the unknown [LANDS] far [BEYOND] the [WALL] , fought valiantly at the [FIST] against monsters which they didn't even know existed , and they will [NEVER] see a [MAN] that brave again . he closes the eulogy with the traditional closing line for members of the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] , and now , his [WATCH] is [ENDED] , which the assembled [MEN] repeat . 
in the main [HALL] , [LORD] commander [JEOR MORMONT] is checking a map in his journal , as craster continues to crassly berate the [MEN] of the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] . [JEOR MORMONT] says that they have to stay long enough for their wounded to recover sufficiently to be fit to travel , but craster waves this off , saying they've recovered as much as they ever will . craster openly suggests that they should just [KILL] the [MEN] who are so severely wounded that they won't be able to travel , and if [JEOR MORMONT] is reluctant to do the deed himself , he can just leave and craster will finish them off . [JEOR MORMONT] declines . another young [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] [MAN] , karl tanner , comes in to complain that craster is feeding them nothing but bread cut with sawdust , and he wants to know where craster keeps his hidden larder . meanwhile , craster is sitting there getting quite drunk on the wine they gifted to him when they [FIRST] came . rast joins in the accusations , and craster admits that he has [WINTER] stockpiles , but he needs those to feed his women and refuses to share them . rast calls craster a bastard at which craster becomes enraged and threatens rast with an axe .

[JEOR MORMONT] [MAY] have a knife in his back but he is twice rast's size and completely enraged .

at the city of astapor in slaver's bay , [DAENERYS] [TARGARYEN] arrives before kraznys mo nakloz and the other slave masters of the city , with her [DOTHRAKI] guards carrying the largest of her [DRAGONS] , drogon , in its large cage . [DAENERYS] is accompanied by her queensgard members , ser [JORAH MORMONT] and ser [BARRISTAN SELMY] . missandei the translator , gifted to [DAENERYS] at her request , is now dressed in higher quality clothing which matches dany's style of dress . all eight thousand of the [UNSULLIED] warrior eunuchs are gathered in the city's main square for the transaction . the other upper class [MEN] and women of astapor crowd around the square , gawking at the dragon while slaves in heavy [CHAINS] serve them refreshments . 
 [DAENERYS] reveals drogon . kraznys tells [DAENERYS] , via missandei's interpretation in the low valyrian language , that many of the [UNSULLIED] have not yet seen [BATTLE] , so she would do well to attack some minor cities and towns here and there on her way to westeros . the slavers will happily purchase any slaves she captures , so it's a [WIN] win situation . he also wryly notes that any young boys she sells as slaves will be castrated and ready to serve as [NEW] [UNSULLIED] when their training is over in about ten years' time . [DAENERYS] lets her dragon out of its cage , and leads it on a long chain leash attached to its foot as it hovers about twenty feet in the air . she hands the leash to kraznys , and in return he gives her a cat o nine tails with a hilt shaped like a [HARPY] , signifying ownership of the [UNSULLIED] . [DAENERYS] asks if it is done , and kraznys impatiently says that it is , as he struggles to rein in the dragon . 
to the surprise of missandei , [DAENERYS] calls the [UNSULLIED] to attention in valyrian , and proceeds to test them with basic valyrian marching commands . she smiles slightly , knowing they are now hers . too distracted to notice , kraznys complains for missandei to tell the bitch that the dragon won't [COME] when he commands . [DAENERYS] turns to face kraznys and bluntly says a dragon is not a slave , again in perfectly accented valyrian . when a dumbfounded kraznys demands an explanation , she declares that she is [DAENERYS] stormborn of [HOUSE TARGARYEN] , of the [BLOOD] of [OLD] [VALYRIA] valyrian is her [MOTHER] tongue indicating she'd been feigning ignorance the entire time and putting up with kraznys' insulting comments to lull them into a false sense of security . 
drogon burns kraznys the [UNSULLIED] sack astapor . [DAENERYS] then addresses the thousands of [UNSULLIED] , and orders them to [KILL] all of the slave masters in astapor , along with all of their household soldiers and any [MAN] who holds a whip . she cautions them to spare any [CHILDREN] , and to strike the [CHAINS] off any slave they see . the [UNSULLIED] obey her commands [WITHOUT] question , and instantly begin attacking all of the assembled slave masters . kraznys frantically shouts for someone to [KILL] [DAENERYS] , to which she calmly orders dracarys . drogon breathes [FIRE] onto kraznys , completely engulfing the slaver in flames as he thrashes about in his death throes . her dragon then flies across the upper walls where the other [HIGH] ranking slave masters are watching , burning them all to death . the [UNSULLIED] proceed to sack the entire city , slaughtering the slave masters and freeing fellow slaves , supported by the [FIRE] of [DAENERYS]' [DRAGONS] . 
after the sack of astapor is finished , [DAENERYS] walks past kraznys' charred remains , mounts a [WHITE] horse , and addresses her [UNSULLIED] . she declares that they have spent their entire lives as slaves , but now she sets them [FREE] . if any [MAN] wishes to leave , she will not stop him , and no harm will [COME] to him if he goes . she asks the [UNSULLIED] to stay and fight for her , not as slaves but as [FREE] [MEN] . for a moment the [UNSULLIED] stare blankly they have [NEVER] known what freedom is . then one starts tapping the [END] of his spear against the ground in support , and the others join in , until thousands of [UNSULLIED] are triumphantly striking their spears against the ground in praise of [DAENERYS] . she has what her brother dreamed about for seventeen years but could [NEVER] find an army with which to reconquer the [SEVEN KINGDOMS] . 
 [DAENERYS] marches forward with her army and [DRAGONS] .

tormund warns [JON] . [JON SNOW] is with the group of twenty wildlings under the command of tormund , who were sent ahead of the main army of king [BEYOND] the [WALL] mance rayder to scale the [WALL] and attack [CASTLE BLACK] from behind . [JON SNOW] and ygritte are gathering firewood , when the warg orell asks him about the defenses of the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] . orell has seen through the eyes of his eagle that there are patrols on top of the [WALL] and he wants to know how frequent they are . [JON SNOW] says they usually sent out patrols in teams of four , [TWO] builders to inspect for structural damage and [TWO] rangers to protect them , but that the frequency of their patrols often changes . orell says the wildlings know there are nineteen castles along the south side of the [WALL] , but he wants to know how many are currently manned . [JON SNOW] finds this very unpleasant , but reluctantly says that only three are currently manned . apart from [CASTLE BLACK] which even the wildlings know is manned , there is also eastwatch by the sea at the extreme eastern [END] , and the shadow [TOWER] at the western [END] . [JON SNOW] is then asked how many [MEN] currently garrison [CASTLE BLACK] . [JON SNOW] is very reluctant to answer , but after being threatened by orell , he gives an exaggerated number , saying there are one thousand [MEN] this is a lie , as [CASTLE BLACK] only had six hundred [MEN] before the [GREAT] ranging , and the garrison now is closer to three hundred . tormund tells [JON SNOW] that he likes him , but if he's lying to them , he'll rip his guts out through his throat .

 [JON SNOW] and ygritte taking a bath after sex . some time after they finish having sex , they lie together in a naked embrace . ygritte asks if that thing you did with your mouth is what lords do to their ladies in the south , but [JON SNOW] says she just seemed to like it when he [KISSED] her there . he admits he's [NEVER] had sex with anyone before and is a maid , though ygritte starts listing off some wildling boys she's had sex with before . the [FIRST] was a [BOY] who also had [RED] hair like her , which is rare among the wildlings and considered very lucky they call having [RED] hair being [KISSED] by [FIRE] , and another was a thenn that was built like an ox , but he could not speak the common tongue . [JON SNOW] and ygritte then slide into the hot springs pool to take a bath together and romantically cuddle more . ygritte tells [JON SNOW] she wishes they could stay in this cave forever instead of having to leave and face the [WINTER] , [WARS] , and monsters outside .

in slaver's bay , [DAENERYS] [HOUSE TARGARYEN] ['S] [NEW] army of freed [UNSULLIED] , having just sacked astapor , head [NORTH] to the next of the three [GREAT] slaver cities , yunkai . ser [JORAH MORMONT] tells ser [BARRISTAN SELMY] how he was knighted at the [END] of the [GREYJOY] rebellion , in which they both fought . [JORAH MORMONT] explains that he was the [SECOND] [MAN] through the breach during the siege of pyke , right behind [THOROS] of [MYR] , who charged in headlong waving about his flaming sword . [BARRISTAN SELMY] thinks this is amusing as he wasn't there he was commanding the siege of [OLD] wyk at the time . king [ROBERT BARATHEON] himself knighted [JORAH MORMONT] for his bravery that day , the proudest of [JORAH MORMONT] ['S] life , though he says what he was most thinking about was that he really needed to piss because he'd been sealed in metal plate armor for sixteen hours straight . 
 [BARRISTAN SELMY] admits that [ROBERT BARATHEON] was a good [MAN] and a good warrior , but laments that he turned out to be a terrible king . [BARRISTAN SELMY] laments that he wasted so much of his life defending kings who didn't deserve it seventeen years defending [ROBERT BARATHEON] , and the mad king [AERYS TARGARYEN] before that . [BARRISTAN SELMY] explains that a [MAN] of [HONOR] must [KEEP] his vows no matter what , whether he's serving a drunk or a lunatic the reason why he [NEVER] turned on king [AERYS TARGARYEN] the way [JAIME] [LANNISTER] ultimately did . [BARRISTAN SELMY] says that just once before he dies , he wants to know what it's like to serve with pride , fighting for someone he believes in . 
their talk turns to [DAENERYS] , and [JORAH MORMONT] says that [BARRISTAN SELMY] can believe in her . [BARRISTAN SELMY] says she'll have good [MEN] to advise her , though he respectfully warns that it might not be well for her to be seen with [JORAH MORMONT] at her side when they return to westeros [JORAH MORMONT] admits that he [MAY NEVER] be rid of the moral taint of selling slaves , which is abhorred in westeros . [JORAH MORMONT] then begins to subtly ask about the advisors on the small council , if any of them spoke against [ROBERT BARATHEON] when he wanted [DAENERYS] , the last [AERYS TARGARYEN] , assassinated . it becomes apparent that [JORAH MORMONT] is trying to figure out if [BARRISTAN SELMY] knew that [JORAH MORMONT] was initially a spy for king [ROBERT BARATHEON] , reporting back to [VARYS] . [JORAH MORMONT] ['S] report that [DAENERYS] was pregnant is what made [ROBERT BARATHEON] demand that [DAENERYS] be assassinated at a small council meeting with ned [STARK] . [JORAH MORMONT] points out that the [LORD] commander of the [KINGSGUARD] traditionally holds a seat on the small council . however , [BARRISTAN SELMY] explains that as a former [KINGSGUARD] member under [AERYS TARGARYEN] , and one who'd killed several of [ROBERT BARATHEON] ['S] friends , while [ROBERT BARATHEON] didn't mind keeping him in his position as a guard , he [MAY NEVER] really trusted his advice , so he left him out of small council meetings . [JORAH MORMONT] is relieved that [BARRISTAN SELMY] was therefore not present at any council meeting so he couldn't have learned that [JORAH MORMONT] was sending it reports on [DAENERYS] . [JORAH MORMONT] and [BARRISTAN SELMY] briefly bicker about the fact that [BARRISTAN SELMY] only just came to them , while [JORAH MORMONT] was defending [DAENERYS] from [ROBERT BARATHEON] ['S] assassins for months , and [BARRISTAN SELMY] isn't [LORD] commander here [JORAH MORMONT] takes his orders from [DAENERYS] . 
meanwhile , [DAENERYS] and her translator aide de camp missandei meet with the assembled officers of the [UNSULLIED] . she addresses them in low valyrian , and says that now that they are no longer slaves but [FREE] [MEN] and they can make their own choices , and she asked them to choose one among them to be leader of all the [UNSULLIED] . they part ranks and one of the eunuchs steps forward . she asks him to remove his helmet and tell her his [NAME] , and he introduces himself as grey worm . [DAENERYS] is confused , and missandei explains that when the slavemasters of astapor castrate slave boys to train them as [UNSULLIED] , they force [NEW] slave names onto them which are intentionally demeaning , usually a combination of a color and a kind of vermin , i.e . grey worm , [RED] flea , [BLACK] rat , etc . this is to enforce the mentality in the [UNSULLIED] that this is just what they are worthless , expendable vermin . disgusted , [DAENERYS] issues the command that all [UNSULLIED] must choose their own [NEW] names as [FREE] [MEN] , or reclaim the names their parents gave them . the [UNSULLIED] commander says that he will continue to be known as grey worm his original [NAME] is accursed , because it was the [NAME] he had when he was taken as a slave , but grey worm is a lucky [NAME] he will [BEAR] with pride , because it is the [NAME] he had when he was set [FREE] by [DAENERYS] stormborn of [HOUSE TARGARYEN] . [DAENERYS] is deeply touched by his loyalty .

at riverrun , the prisoners martyn and willem [LANNISTER] squires fifteen and fourteen years [OLD] , respectively awake to hear shouting and fighting outside the [DOOR] to their cell . [LORD] [RICKARD KARSTARK] fights his way into the room with some of his own [MEN] . confused , willem asks if this is a rescue , and is promptly killed by the [RICKARD KARSTARK] [MEN] . martyn begs that he is just a squire and didn't do anything , but [LORD] [RICKARD KARSTARK] ignores his pleas and stabs him in the belly with a dagger , killing him . . 
martyn and willem lie [DEAD] before [ROBB] . 
the bloody corpses of the [TWO] [LANNISTER] prisoners are laid out on the floor in front of king in the [NORTH] [ROBB STARK] in riverrun's main meeting room . [ROBB STARK] is disgusted , remarking that [RICKARD KARSTARK] needed five [MEN] to brutally murder [TWO] unarmed squires in their own prison cell . [RICKARD KARSTARK] insists that it was a father's vengeance . [ROBB STARK] points out that these boys had nothing to do with the death of [RICKARD KARSTARK] ['S] [SONS] , who were both killed by [JAIME] [LANNISTER] . [RICKARD KARSTARK] explains that he was denied his vengeance when [ROBB STARK] ['S] [MOTHER] [CATELYN] set [JAIME] [FREE] in hopes of a prisoner exchange for her daughters in king's landing . finally having enough , [RICKARD KARSTARK] did the next best thing , and killed [JAIME] ['S] kin who they held prisoner . [ROBB STARK] angrily shouts that they were only little boys , and [RICKARD KARSTARK] can't blame [CATELYN] for his treasonous killing of prisoners of war . [RICKARD KARSTARK] stands firm , and says the only treason is in letting their enemies go , when in war they should be killing them if [ROBB STARK] ['S] father ever taught him that . brynden [TULLY] punches [RICKARD KARSTARK] over this remark , but [ROBB STARK] tells him to leave [RICKARD KARSTARK] alone . [RICKARD KARSTARK] has utterly lost faith in [ROBB STARK] , and says that the king in the [NORTH] will just give him a scolding , though he should probably call him the king who lost the [NORTH] after he allowed [WINTERFELL] to fall . [ROBB STARK] orders all of [RICKARD KARSTARK] ['S] [MEN] hanged , and to hang the lookout last so he can [WATCH] the others [DIE] . [RICKARD KARSTARK] himself is sent to the dungeons . 
 [ROBB STARK] ['S] uncle edmure [TULLY] insists that if word of this leaves riverrun , [TYWIN LANNISTER] will exact heavy reprisals for the deaths of his young nephews . therefore , he suggests that they just quietly bury the boys , and simply [KEEP] silent about their deaths until the war is over . [ROBB STARK] , however , refuses to be a liar he says he can not fight a war in the [NAME] of justice if he will not serve justice to murderers within his own ranks . all of [ROBB STARK] ['S] advisors tell him this is a bad idea . [CATELYN] and his wife [TALISA] warn him that the [RICKARD KARSTARK] soldiers will abandon his cause and return [HOME] if he executes their [LORD] , and they are already badly outnumbered . [CATELYN] says they should [KEEP] [LORD] [RICKARD KARSTARK] hostage , and edmure agrees , saying that they can just [KEEP] him hostage and tell the other karstarks that no harm will [COME] to him so long as they remain loyal . . 
 [ROBB STARK] executes [RICKARD KARSTARK] . 
 [ROBB STARK] ignores their pleas , and he has [LORD] [RICKARD KARSTARK] brought out to the courtyard of riverrun to be executed during a driving rainstorm . [RICKARD KARSTARK] points out that not only are both of their [HOUSES] descended from the [FIRST] [MEN] , but the karstarks and karstarks are kin as [HOUSE KARSTARK] is a cadet branch of [HOUSE STARK] , founded centuries ago by younger son karlon [HOUSE STARK] . [ROBB STARK] says that their [BLOOD] relationship did not stop [RICKARD KARSTARK] from betraying him and won't stop [ROBB STARK] from executing him now , but [RICKARD KARSTARK] says it isn't meant to he wants it to haunt [ROBB STARK] until the day he dies . with his last [WORDS] , [LORD] [RICKARD KARSTARK] says that [ROBB STARK] will be cursed as a kinslayer and that [ROBB STARK] is no king of his . obedient to the [LAWS] of his father [EDDARD STARK] that the [MAN] who passes the sentence must swing the sword [ROBB STARK] pronounces the sentence of death and personally beheads [LORD] [RICKARD KARSTARK] . 
 [ROBB STARK] ['S] strict adherence to justice makes [THINGS] turn out just as badly as his advisors said they would the karstarks withdraw their soldiers from his army and march for [HOME] , resulting in [ROBB STARK] losing almost half of his forces which were stationed at riverrun . [ROBB STARK] openly admits to [TALISA] that she was right , and he made a mistake . [ROBB STARK] says [TYWIN LANNISTER] realizes that he's in such a strong position he doesn't even need to attack the northerners anymore , he just needs to wait , and let their demoralized forces unravel . when the war began [ROBB STARK] ['S] army was unified around a central purpose , but now they have lost momentum , and his generals are acting like bickering [CHILDREN] . [ROBB STARK] shows [TALISA] a war map of the [SEVEN KINGDOMS] depicting [ROBB STARK] ['S] armies concentrated around riverrun and [HARRENHAL] , [TYWIN LANNISTER] and [TYRELL] armies overrunning the [STORMLANDS] , [TYWIN LANNISTER] [TYRELL] armies concentrated in king's landing , and [GREYJOY] forces occupying the western coasts of the [NORTH] . [TALISA] suggests that he try to take the fight to the [LANNISTERS] if they won't [COME] to him , but he explains that this is hopeless . taking king's landing would have been difficult to begin with , but now [TYWIN LANNISTER] and the bulk of the main [TYWIN LANNISTER] army , as well as a large [TYRELL] army , are defending the city . attacking the capital head on would be suicide , and [TYWIN LANNISTER] would crush them within a day . [TALISA] suggests that he lead his army back to the [NORTH] to repulse the greyjoys from his homeland and rebuild his powerbase . [ROBB STARK] points out that as soon as all of his tired soldiers are back [HOME] , they won't want to leave again particularly because [WINTER] is [COMING] , and the [COMING] one is expected to be very long , five years or more . the northerners have been away from their farms fighting in the war , however , so they haven't even begun to collect harvests to set aside as [WINTER] stockpiles . thus if [ROBB STARK] returns to the [NORTH] , it will be difficult to rally his [MEN] to return south to defend the riverlords who declared for him . eyeing the map with [TALISA] , [ROBB STARK] decides that if king's landing is too strong to attack and he can't return [HOME] , his only remaining option is to strike where his enemy is weakest . [ROBB STARK] decides that with the main [TYWIN LANNISTER] army group under [TYWIN LANNISTER] now positioned all the way to the east in king's landing , he needs to return to the westerlands and make an all or nothing assault against casterly rock . this will make the [LANNISTERS] lose face , just as [ROBB STARK] did when he lost his [HOME] [CASTLE] of [WINTERFELL] , and bring momentum back to his army . however , with the loss of the [RICKARD KARSTARK] forces , they don't currently have enough [MEN] to consider attacking casterly rock . the only way they can gain enough soldiers to even attempt such an assault is if [ROBB STARK] can [TYWIN LANNISTER] back the allegiance of [HOUSE FREY] , whose thousands of soldiers withdrew from [ROBB STARK] ['S] army when he broke his promise to make a marriage alliance with them by marrying [TALISA] , a political nobody , instead of one of the [LORD] [WALDER FREY] ['S] daughters . thus , [ROBB STARK] must try to repair his alliance with [HOUSE FREY] . 
locke taunting [JAIME] about his [HAND] . at [HARRENHAL] , locke presents the captive [JAIME] [TYWIN LANNISTER] and brienne of [TARTH] to the northern castellan , [LORD] [ROOSE BOLTON] . locke is quite proud of himself for his torture of [JAIME] , but [ROOSE BOLTON] is surprised that [JAIME] has lost his [HAND] . oblivious , locke boasts that [JAIME] hasn't lost the [HAND] , and points out that he cut it off and hung [JAIME] ['S] own [HAND] around his [NECK] . angered that locke maimed such a valuable hostage , [ROOSE BOLTON] demands that he dispose of [JAIME] ['S] rotting [HAND] , and orders that accommodations be provided for the pair of prisoners . when [JAIME] asks if there is news from the capital , [ROOSE BOLTON] informs him that [STANNIS BARATHEON] laid siege to the city in the [BATTLE] of the [BLACKWATER] ... then needlessly drags out revealing the result . [ROOSE BOLTON] toys with [JAIME] but remains completely calm , [NEVER] even grinning , before finally revealing that his sister [CERSEI] is alive and well , and his father's forces successfully repulsed [STANNIS BARATHEON] ['S] assault . [JAIME] is so overcome by delirium and relief that his family is safe that he collapses . [ROOSE BOLTON] calls for qyburn to attend to [JAIME] ['S] injuries . later , qyburn peels away the crude tourniquet that locke's [MEN] applied to [JAIME] , and finds that the stump of his right arm has become badly infected . [JAIME] asks if he will [DIE] , and qyburn says he won't , but the corruption has spread to the point that it would be safest just to amputate the rest of his right arm at the shoulder . half delirious from the infection , [JAIME] refuses , and says he'll [KILL] qyburn if he tries . [JAIME] then notices that qyburn is not a maester , because he isn't wearing a maester's chain of office . qyburn acknowledges this , explaining that he was stripped of his chain by the citadel and thrown out of the order of maesters , because as he says , he was conducting experiments which they felt were too bold . qyburn gets ready to cut [JAIME] , and says he'll at least try to save his elbow , but with a sudden burst of effort [JAIME] grabs him around the throat with his left [HAND] , and says he doesn't need his right [HAND] to [KILL] him . qyburn relents , and says he could try cutting out the chunks of flesh which are outright rotten , then burning out the wounds with boiling wine , and with luck this might be able to stop the infection [WITHOUT] having to amputate more of [JAIME] ['S] arm above the wrist . [JAIME] says he's willing to try this , but qyburn cautions that it will cause a [GREAT] amount of pain so he needs to give him milk of the poppy , but [JAIME] refuses to take it , and says he'll just scream . qyburn cautions him that it will cause a massive amount of pain , but [JAIME] says that he will just scream loudly . qyburn begins to dig into the stump of [JAIME] ['S] arm to cut out the gangrenous tissue , and [JAIME] howls in agony . 
some time later , brienne is in [HARRENHAL] ['S] bathhouse , scrubbing off weeks' worth of caked on grime and filth from the trek through the [RIVERLANDS] . [JAIME] then appears in the doorway assisted by a servant , barely able to stand due to the pain he is in . he asks the servant to help him take off his muddy rags and leave . [JAIME] then walks naked into the same communal bath that brienne is in , on the far side . she is also naked and angrily points out that there are other baths , but he says he wants this one he's afraid he's going to pass out at any moment , and wants her to save him from drowning if he does , because he doesn't want to be the [FIRST] [TYWIN LANNISTER] to [DIE] in a bathtub . brienne asks why she should care how he dies , but he points out that she swore a solemn vow to get him to king's landing in one piece which indicating the stump of his [HAND] has not been going so well . [JAIME] quips that it's no wonder [RENLY] died with brienne guarding him , at which she defiantly stands up out of the bath , facing him fully nude , to show him she isn't afraid of him . [JAIME] gravely says that was unworthy and asks for forgiveness , brienne angrily orders him not to mock her , but he insists he's seriously apologizing . exhausted , [JAIME] says he's tired of fighting and just wants to have a truce brienne says you need trust to have a truce , but he says he trusts her , so she sits back down . 
 [JAIME] recounts [AERYS] ['S] madness . [JAIME] then notes that brienne has the same look on her face that he's seen on countless [FACES] in the past seventeen years people that despise him , call him kingslayer more than his own [NAME] , or [OATHBREAKER] and a [MAN WITHOUT HONOR] . [JAIME] then goes on to recall the mad king's obsession with wildfire , how [AERYS] enjoyed watching people being burned alive . [JAIME] recalls [AERYS] burned lords he didn't like , hands who failed him , and anyone he thought was against him . ultimately , half of westeros rebelled against him , so [AERYS] had his pyromancers place caches of wildfire all over king's landing under the [GREAT SEPT] of [BAELOR] , under the slums of flea bottom , under [HOUSES] , stables , taverns , and even under the [RED KEEP] itself . after [ROBERT] ['S] victory at the trident he marched on the capital city , but [JAIME] ['S] father [TYWIN LANNISTER] arrived there [FIRST] , leading the entire [TYWIN LANNISTER] army , and promising to defend the city . [JAIME] warned [AERYS] that his father was [NEVER] a [MAN WITHOUT HONOR] to choose the losing side , that this must be a trick and he should surrender the city while he still could , but the mad king refused to listen . nor did [AERYS] listen to [VARYS] when he gave the same warning that [TYWIN LANNISTER] couldn't be trusted but he did listen to grand maester [PYCELLE] , who convinced [AERYS] the [LANNISTERS] were there to help . [AERYS] opened the city gates , and the [LANNISTERS] proceeded to sack the city . [JAIME] again begged [AERYS] to surrender , but the mad king ordered [JAIME] to bring him [TYWIN LANNISTER] ['S] head , and his pyromancer to set the city ablaze , burning its hundreds of thousands of inhabitants with wildfire . [JAIME] makes it plain to brienne that was his breaking point and asks her what she would do if her precious [RENLY] commanded her to [KILL] her own father and then stand by and do nothing as he murdered thousands of innocent people she can only sit in shocked silence . [JAIME] goes on to say that he killed the pyromancer [FIRST] , then drove his sword into [AERYS] ['S] back as the mad king tried to run for his life . shaken at the memory , [JAIME] speculates that king [AERYS] didn't believe he would [DIE] in the blaze in his lunacy , the mad king believed he would be reborn as a dragon in the [FIRE] , granting him the power to burn his enemies to ashes ... so [JAIME] finished [AERYS] off by slitting his throat in order to make sure he died , concluding that [EDDARD STARK] found him at that point . 
stunned , brienne asks why [JAIME] didn't defend himself with this account before . [JAIME] angrily rants that the honorable [LORD] [EDDARD STARK] would [NEVER] have believed a word he said [EDDARD STARK] didn't want to hear [JAIME] ['S] side of the story when he'd already judged him guilty . [JAIME] faints . [JAIME] goes on to rage , yelling what right [EDDARD STARK] had to judge him , by what right the [WOLF] dares to judge the [LION] . the strain of recounting his harrowing tale overcomes [JAIME] , however , and he begins to faint , nearly falling face [FIRST] into the [WATER] . brienne catches him and calls for help for the kingslayer , at which as he slips out of consciousness he whimpers to himself [JAIME] . my [NAME] is [JAIME] . 
the hound vs [BERIC] . 
elsewhere in the [RIVERLANDS] , at the hideout of the [BROTHERHOOD] [MAN WITHOUT HONOR] banners in hollow hill , sandor [CLEGANE] prepares to fight [BERIC] dondarrion in a trial by combat . as both [MEN] prepare , [THOROS] of [MYR] prays to the [LORD] of light to judge sandor for his crimes if he is guilty or give strength to his sword if he is innocent . before the fight begins , [BERIC] calls upon the [LORD] of light to ignite his sword with flame , using only his [BLOOD] . due to the sandor's fear of [FIRE] , [BERIC] initially has an advantage against the hound . [BERIC] even manages to set sandor's wooden shield on [FIRE] , which is strapped so tightly to sandor's arm that he can not remove it and is nearly burned himself . eventually , however , sandor's raw physical strength and anger born of terror overpowers [BERIC] , and with a single downward swipe , cuts right through his flaming sword , his armor , and deep into his shoulder , killing him . 
 [THOROS] reviving [BERIC] . 
as [BERIC] falls to the ground , [THOROS] quickly rushes to his side , and begins praying to the [LORD] of light to revive him . sandor falls to the ground to desperately try and extinguish his flaming shield . arya [EDDARD STARK] grabs a dagger and attempts to [KILL] the hound while he is down , but she is stopped by [GENDRY] . as she curses him , sandor taunts arya over how the god prefers him over her [DEAD] friend , however they are both interrupted by [BERIC] , who has been revived by the [LORD] of light's power . having won the trial , and proven his innocence in the eyes of god , sandor is allowed to leave . the [BROTHERHOOD] had taken all of the gold sandor had on him to fund their cause , and in lieu of returning it , [BERIC] gives him a promissory note which will grant payment at the [END] of the war . sandor scoffs at this and throws it to the ground , but anguy says he should be thankful they're letting him leave with his life . [CLEGANE] is hooded so he won't know the way back to their hideout , then led away to be released some distance away . 
after the fight , [GENDRY] works on repairing [BERIC] ['S] armor , and arya questions why , because they will be leaving soon . [GENDRY] says that he has decided to stay and work as a smith for the [BROTHERHOOD] [MAN WITHOUT HONOR] banners , to aid them in their cause to protect the smallfolk during the war . arya says that their plan was to find her brother [ROBB] , and [ROBB] needs soldiers too , but [GENDRY] points out that he has no attachments to [ROBB STARK] arya would be going to her noble born family , and he'd just be serving another [LORD] . [GENDRY] says he's been serving other [MEN] his whole life and he has nothing to show for it he worked most of his life for tobho mott and he repaid [GENDRY] by selling him to the [NIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] as soon as the secret payments from [VARYS] [ENDED] , and he served [TYWIN LANNISTER] as a prisoner at [HARRENHAL] , every day afraid he'd be killed or tortured . he'd be serving in the [BROTHERHOOD] too , but they chose [BERIC] as their leader , and they're more like a family and as a common born tavern [MAIDEN] ['S] son who was orphaned at a young age , [GENDRY] has [NEVER] had a family . arya sadly chokes out that she could be his family . in response , [GENDRY] politely but firmly points out that the class differences between them mean that if he goes back with her , they'd [NEVER] be family he'd still be a commoner , and she'd be m'lady . 
later that [NIGHT] , arya looks into the campfire and recites her nightly prayer list for the death of her enemies . [THOROS] says that they plan to bring her to riverrun to reunite her with her family , and in exchange for a reward from [ROBB STARK] to fund their cause . arya points out that they are ransoming her , and [THOROS] admits they technically are , but this is different . they do intend to escort her safely through the war ravaged countryside to her family , and [BERIC] would like to return her for [FREE] out of memory of her father , but they really need the gold to support themselves . [BERIC] says he knows she must be angry with him , but releasing sandor was the right thing to do , as they'd promised to let him go [FREE] if he won the trial by combat . arya is still quietly upset , as she's now seen many honorable [MEN] [KEEP] their promises and behave lawfully only to be killed for it such as yoren and her own father . she wonders why [BERIC] would want to let sandor go when he nearly killed him , but [BERIC] insists that he did actually [KILL] him . when arya asks how , [BERIC] points her to [THOROS] to explain , but he says that he isn't the one who brings [BERIC] back to life , it's the [LORD] of light , and [THOROS] is just the lucky drunk who recites the prayers . [BERIC] opens his shirt to reveal several grievous scars on his torso they explain that [BERIC] has actually died and then been brought back to life six times now , counting his recent death in the trial by combat . he has been impaled on a lance , shot with an arrow , and at his fifth death the [LANNISTERS] hanged him for treason and stuck a dagger in his eye which didn't heal when [THOROS] brought him back . arya earnestly asks [THOROS] if he could bring back to life a [MAN WITHOUT HONOR] a head . [THOROS] and [BERIC] both understand that she is asking about bringing back her father , but [THOROS] says he doesn't think it works that way both because he was decapitated , and because he's been [DEAD] for far too long by now . [BERIC] consoles her that her father was a good [MAN WITHOUT HONOR] , but he wouldn't wish his resurrected life on him . [BERIC] explains that being brought back from the [DEAD] carries a heavy toll , as pieces of his memory and who he was before chip away each time . arya still says she would wish [BERIC] ['S] life on her father , because at least [BERIC] is still alive . 
at dragonstone , king [STANNIS BARATHEON] is still deeply depressed after his defeat at the [BATTLE] of the [BLACKWATER] , and doesn't have the daily support of the [RED] priestess melisandre since she left on what she claimed was an important mission . most of [STANNIS BARATHEON]' army has been destroyed , and the only reason the [LANNISTERS] haven't attacked dragonstone yet is because so much of their fleet was destroyed at [BLACKWATER] that they can not yet mount an amphibious assault . with little else to do , [STANNIS BARATHEON] takes the time to visit his wife , queen [SELYSE] who was born into [HOUSE FLORENT] , for the [FIRST] time since returning from the [BATTLE] . he finds her in her chamber , praying over a [FIRE] to the [LORD] of light [SELYSE] is a fanatical believer in the [LORD] of light religion , far more so than [STANNIS BARATHEON] , and it was indeed [SELYSE] who [FIRST] invited melisandre to dragonstone . [STANNIS BARATHEON] and [SELYSE] do not have a loving relationship , but she reveres and is in awe of him as her king and the [LORD] ['S] chosen . she tells him not to despair despite his defeat , and he will be victorious , but he laments that he used to believe that once . due to his extreme belief in duty , unlike his hedonistic brother [ROBERT] [STANNIS BARATHEON] is badly shaken by the fact that he broke his marriage vows to [SELYSE] , when he had sex with melisandre to create the shadow assassin creature that killed [RENLY] . he begins to confess to [SELYSE] that he has sinned and shamed her , but she interrupts him and says melisandre already told her everything and that no act done in service of the [LORD] of light can be a sin . indeed , she wept for joy when melisandre told her of this service she did for the [LORD] of light with [STANNIS BARATHEON] , and because the [RED] priestess gave him a son of sorts which she [NEVER] could . [STANNIS BARATHEON]' face is filled with a mix of shock , disgust , and relief . [SELYSE] had three [SONS] with [STANNIS BARATHEON] but they were all stillborn , and she walks over to a corner of her chamber where she keeps their tiny corpses preserved in glass jars . the deaths of her sweet boys and failure to produce a male heir deeply affected [SELYSE] , and caused her to zealously embrace the foreign religion of the [LORD] of light . she weeps , and laments that she has given [STANNIS BARATHEON] nothing he does not blame her , and with pity he says that's not true . [SELYSE] understands he is referring to their daughter and only child , princess [SHIREEN] [STANNIS BARATHEON] . she grows annoyed when she realizes he's [COME] to see her too , and says he shouldn't [WASTE] time on such distractions , but insists that she is his daughter , and she relents because it is not her place to question her king . [SHIREEN] visits [DAVOS] while in the dungeons . 
 [SHIREEN] is alone in her room drawing and singing a song about life under the sea to herself , and is excited to see her father . she is a cheerful but sickly young girl about the same age as arya [ROBB STARK] , with the left side of her face badly scarred and disfigured by the dreaded greyscale disease . [STANNIS BARATHEON] wanted to see his daughter , but he is awkward in expressing warm emotions to her . she says she heard he was in a [BATTLE] and asks if he won , and he good naturedly says no . [SHIREEN] is slightly let down , but asks if the [ONION KNIGHT] came back as well ser [DAVOS] seaworth has been her friend during his service to her father , and he even made her a toy ship . growing tense over their falling out , [STANNIS BARATHEON] briefly explains that ser [DAVOS] is a traitor and is rotting in the dungeon . confused , he flatly says she should best put him out of her mind . 
later that [ONION KNIGHT] , [SHIREEN] sneaks down to the dungeon of dragonstone and finds the cell of ser [ONION KNIGHT] . he wakes up and tells her she shouldn't be there , but she explains that the fat guard bert is on duty , who usually drinks a lot of wine and sleeps through his [WATCH] . she asks if it is true that he is a traitor , and he says that it is , as he disobeyed her father . she says she doesn't care , he's her friend . she was worried that he must get bored down in his cell , so she brought him a [BOOK] to read , about aegon the conquer and his [DRAGONS] she excitedly points out that the targaryens built dragonstone , and aegon used to live in this very [CASTLE] . [DAVOS] reluctantly explains that it's wasted on him , because he doesn't know how to read . undaunted , [SHIREEN] offers to teach him how to read , by [COMING] down to his cell and reading to him when bert is on duty . [DAVOS] chides her that they can't , but she asks what's the worst the guards could do to them if they find out , lock them in cells they have a quiet laugh , and [SHIREEN] starts to read to [DAVOS] an history of aegon the conqueror and his conquest of westeros . 
in king's landing , queen regent [CERSEI] [LANNISTER] encounters petyr littlefinger [BAELISH] in a courtyard , and tells him she fears that the tyrells do not have the [LANNISTERS]' best interests at heart , but her father won't listen . therefore , she asks that littlefinger use his spies to try to find out what they're up to , because he has a good working relationship with them after brokering the [LANNISTER] [TYRELL] alliance . he agrees , but [CERSEI] warns him that this had better produce more results than when she previously asked him to find arya [ROBB STARK] , but the girl could not be found . 
in the [CASTLE] [GARDENS] , sansa [ROBB STARK] and [MARGAERY] [TYRELL] [WATCH] her brother ser [LORAS] spar with his squire . sansa confidently remarks on his fighting ability , and inquires when she and [LORAS] will wed , as per the [TYRELL] plot to [KEEP] her out of the hands of [BAELISH] and or the [LANNISTERS] . [MARGAERY] replies that she will plant the seed of the idea after she and [JOFFREY] are married . sansa is skeptical [JOFFREY] will let her go but [MARGAERY] is confident he will do it to please her , once she is his wife . after the match , ser [LORAS]' [NEW] squire olyvar flirts with him , which leads to them having sex back in [LORAS]' chambers . as they finish , [LORAS] mentions that he is engaged to be married ... a fact that olyvar passes on to his real master , littlefinger , so he can pass the information on to [CERSEI] . [LORAS] and olyvar . 
a short time later , littlefinger meets with sansa , offering her a place on his ship that will take him from the capital to the [VALE] of [ARRYN] . sansa practices lying for a change , and tells him that they should wait until after [JOFFREY] ['S] [WEDDING] , primarily because she fears for his safety if the plan fails . a master manipulator , littlefinger is clearly suspicious of her motives , but doesn't press the matter for the moment . instead he says he is touched by her concern for his safety , and insists that she call him petyr . 
at the same time , [TYRION] [LANNISTER] is engaged in a meeting with lady [OLENNA TYRELL] with the upcoming royal [WEDDING] shaping up to be an extravagant and expensive affair , [TYRION] is concerned about the cost . [OLENNA TYRELL] points out that the tyrells have done much to supply the city with soldiers and provisions to assist in the war effort , as well as the [COMING] [WINTER] . [OLENNA TYRELL] is bored to discuss financial matters , but quickly lists off specific details of the soldiers and supplies the tyrells are supplying to aid the [CROWN] , demonstrating that [TYRION] doesn't need to lecture her about wartime expenses . she insists that the royal [WEDDING] must go on as planned , as it will do much to improve the city's morale and [KEEP] the people happy , otherwise they will start blaming the [LANNISTERS] for the war again . [TYRION] can not outmaneuver [OLENNA TYRELL] , but in the [END] she decides on her own that she won't have it said [HOUSE TYRELL] isn't doing its part to help , so she agrees to pay for half the cost of the festivities , for which [TYRION] is grateful . 
 [TYRION] heads to the small council chamber to report success to his father [TYWIN] , only to find [CERSEI] present as well , much to his annoyance . [TYWIN] explains that the tyrells are plotting to wed sansa to ser [LORAS] and states that he will not allow them to steal the key to the [NORTH] out from under him . [TYRION] questions how sansa is the key to the [NORTH] , given that her older brother is still alive . [TYWIN] explains that the desertion of the karstarks have cost [ROBB STARK] half his army , and combined with already being badly outnumbered by the [LANNISTER] [HOUSE TYRELL] alliance his days are now numbered . theon [GREYJOY] murdered [ROBB STARK] ['S] younger brothers at [WINTERFELL] , which makes sansa [ROBB STARK] ['S] heir if he dies , rule of [WINTERFELL] and the [NORTH] goes to her and any [MAN] she marries ... which [TYWIN] has no intention of letting the tyrells get their hands on . [TYRION] questions if it is wise to offend their allies by refusing the match , but [TYWIN] points out that as a plot against them , the tyrells' plan is , by definition , a secret , thus the [LANNISTERS] can't be said to be refusing them something which they aren't officially trying to do . he also notes that the tyrells won't go through with their plan until after [JOFFREY] ['S] [WEDDING] , which means they need to act [FIRST] ... namely by finding sansa another husband . 
after a moment , [TYRION] realizes from the comments of his father and sister that they are talking about him . [TYRION] tries to protest , pointing out that [JOFFREY] has made sansa's life a living hell since the day he had her father executed and to force [TYRION] on her after she has finally escaped [JOFFREY] is cruel , even by [TYWIN] ['S] standards . [TYWIN] questions if [TYRION] plans to mistreat sansa and asserts that he is not concerned with the girl's happiness and neither should his son . [TYRION] protests that sansa is a child , but [CERSEI] counters she has flowered and is a [WOMAN] now who can [BEAR] [CHILDREN] . [TYRION] flatly refuses , but [TYWIN] points out that recently he was complaining that he wasn't rewarded for his actions in the [BATTLE] of the [BLACKWATER] , and as heiress to the [NORTH] , sansa is a far better reward than he could expect , and in any case , it is long past time [TYRION] was wed. at this , [TYRION] snarls that he was wed , referring to his past marriage to tysha , asking if his father has forgotten that . returning his son's hateful glare with one of his own , [TYWIN] retorts that he [REMEMBERS] all too well . [TYWIN] arranges some marriages . 
 [CERSEI] gloats over the matter , but her smug attitude quickly evaporates when her father commands that she will wed ser [LORAS] instead . [CERSEI] flatly refuses , but [TYWIN] is insistent the marriages of [CERSEI] and [TYRION] will place the [NORTH] and the reach firmly in the [LANNISTERS]' control . [TYWIN] points out that [CERSEI] is still fertile she needs to marry and breed . when [CERSEI] protests she is queen regent and not a brood mare , [TYWIN] angrily roars back that she is his daughter and will do as she is told she will marry [LORAS] and in so doing , put an [END] to what [TYWIN] calls the disgusting rumors [STANNIS] has been spreading about her and [JAIME] . [CERSEI] switches to earnestly begging him , calling him father and pleading that he not force her into an arranged marriage a [SECOND] time after her long and loveless marriage with king [ROBERT] . [TYWIN] refuses to listen and storms out in disgust , raging that the pair have disgraced the [LANNISTER] [NAME] for far too long . [CERSEI] slowly shifts her gaze toward [TYRION] to gauge his reaction to her distress but sees he is too glum about his own predicament .

in king's landing , [LORD] [TYWIN LANNISTER] meets with lady [OLENNA TYRELL] to discuss having ser [LORAS] marry his daughter , [CERSEI] . they trade barbs about [CERSEI] ['S] age , [CERSEI] ['S] capability to have more [CHILDREN] , and accusations of incest with [JAIME] , as well as [LORAS] ['S] well known homosexuality . [TYWIN LANNISTER] is adamant that [CERSEI] , whom he calls the kingdom's most beautiful [WOMAN] , should marry [LORAS] , the kingdom's most handsome and desired bachelor , but [OLENNA TYRELL] blatantly refuses to consent , hinting that [JOFFREY] is the result of incest . [TYWIN LANNISTER] replies that if that is true , he has no right to the [THRONE] and the tyrells just threw a flower into the dirt . [OLENNA TYRELL] says she will not risk throwing another flower into the dirt if [CERSEI] can not [BEAR] heirs for the tyrells . realizing her unchanged position on the matter , [TYWIN LANNISTER] threatens to make [LORAS] a [KNIGHT] of the [KINGSGUARD] , which would force [LORAS] to give up his right to marriage and to inherit highgarden . [OLENNA TYRELL] relents , and consents to the marriage of [LORAS] and [CERSEI] . 
in the [GARDENS] , sansa [ROBB STARK] tries to get closer to [LORAS] by discussing their hopefully impending [WEDDING] . [LORAS] is clearly uncomfortable being so close to her , but brightens when discussing the lavish [WEDDING] he's had planned although sansa , for once , becomes suspicious when she realizes that [LORAS] seems more excited by the food and the [WEDDING] joust than by her . [LORAS] quickly placates her with a compliment and then describes the [WEDDING] gown he's envisioned for her . sansa says she's looking forward to seeing highgarden , as she's only ever lived in [WINTERFELL] and can't wait to leave king's landing . in this , [LORAS] finds unexpected common ground with her and agrees that the [RED KEEP] is the most terrible place there is . 
 [CERSEI] and [TYRION] [TYWIN LANNISTER] observe the couple from [CERSEI] ['S] chambers overlooking the [GARDEN] . [TYRION] sarcastically asks which of the four of them has it the worst . he then finally accuses his sister of trying to have him killed during the [BATTLE] of the [BLACKWATER] . [CERSEI] , tired of fighting him , remains quiet while he deduces that only [TWO] people can command the [KINGSGUARD] . [TYRION] realizes that while [CERSEI] certainly has the authority to command a [KINGSGUARD] , she isn't stupid enough to command ser [MANDON MOORE] to [KILL] him in public . [TYRION] realizes that it was in fact [JOFFREY] who ordered ser [MANDON MOORE] to [KILL] him , because [TYRION] was the only one who stood up to him . [CERSEI] tells him his life is not in danger from [JOFFREY] , as he dare not try anything like that now that [TYWIN LANNISTER] is the [HAND] . they discuss about [JAIME] ['S] possible return to king's landing , with [CERSEI] wondering where he could possibly be . she asks [TYRION] which one of them should be the one to break the news to sansa . 
 [TYRION] decides he might as well dash sansa's hopes sooner rather than later . he goes to sansa's chamber and asks for a private word , but sansa declines to dismiss shae . [TYRION] gives shae a carefully coded apology for not telling her in private before breaking the news to sansa . 
later on , [LORD] [VARYS] finds [LORD] petyr [BAELISH] in the [THRONE] room . [VARYS] and [BAELISH] discuss the [IRON THRONE] and the pageantry and propaganda that creates nations and cements dynasties . [VARYS] asserts that he serves the realm , but [BAELISH] scoffs that the realm is an invention of aegon the conqueror . [BAELISH] tells [VARYS] that he is aware of [VARYS]' arrangement with ros , and that he has given her to a friend who is eager for a [NEW] experience . [BAELISH] revels in the chaos that he has caused , likening chaos to a ladder for those brave enough to [CLIMB] rather than a pit to be lost in , as [VARYS] and everyone else sees it . 
 [JOFFREY] kills ros . 
elsewhere , sansa weeps as [BAELISH] ['S] ship departs , both of her plans to leave king's landing in tatters . meanwhile , [JOFFREY] coldly contemplates ros's quarrel ridden corpse . 
in the [RIVERLANDS] , the hideout of the [BROTHERHOOD] [WITHOUT] banners outside of hollow hill , anguy trains arya [ROBB STARK] with a bow . anguy teaching arya how to shoot a bow better . arya spots someone behind her target , which is revealed to be melisandre and a small group of [STANNIS BARATHEON] ['S] [MEN] . she speaks to [THOROS] in [HIGH] valyrian , demanding to know what became of his mission to convert [ROBERT BARATHEON] to the worship of the [LORD] of light . he bluntly tells her he failed . melisandre is brought to the [BROTHERHOOD] ['S] hideout and is shocked when she learns of the six deaths of [BERIC] dondarrion , exclaiming that [THOROS] should not have that kind of power . [THOROS] counters that he has no power , he only asks for favors and the [LORD] of light sees fit to grant them . the priestess seems troubled by his response or perhaps by the fact that the [LORD] of light looks favorably on causes other than her own . melisandre says the [BROTHERHOOD] has someone the [LORD] of light needs , and soon after has her [MEN] take [GENDRY] into her custody . arya protests , particularly when she sees that melisandre has given the [BROTHERHOOD] [TWO] heavy sacks of gold in exchange . she confronts the [RED KEEP] priestess , calling her a witch . melisandre ignores the barb and looks into arya's eyes . she sees many other eyes , of many other colors eyes that arya will shut forever . melisandre abruptly tells her that they will meet again . 
edmure is enraged at having to marry roslin . 
at riverrun , king [ROBB STARK] and his advisors meet with [BLACK] [WALDER] and lothar [JOFFREY] to discuss an alliance for his planned attack on casterly rock . the freys carry [WALDER FREY] ['S] demands for an alliance , which includes a formal apology from [ROBB STARK] , the [CASTLE] [HARRENHAL] and all of its [RIVERLANDS] and incomes , and for edmure [TULLY] to marry roslin , one of his daughters . edmure is reluctant to marry a [WOMAN] he has [NEVER] met , but is eventually convinced by the group to go through with the arrangement .

[JAIME] assumes that brienne will accompany him , but [ROOSE BOLTON] intends to [RED KEEP] her with him , under arrest for abetting treason .

 [DAENERYS] [TARGARYEN] ['S] army marches on to the next [GREAT] city of slaver's bay , yunkai . she and [BARRISTAN SELMY] are confident they can take the city , given that yunkai are famous for training bed slaves rather than soldiers . ser [JORAH] notes with wisdom however that yunkai's defenders won't fight them in open [BATTLE] , being more likely to hole up behind their walls and chip away at the [TARGARYEN] army with guerrilla tactics . he also advises [DAENERYS] that conquering yunkai does not help them with their main goal of pressing on to retake westeros . dany however is adamant on freeing the slaves of yunkai , who number in the hundreds of thousands . she orders grey worm to send a messenger to the city and inform yunkai's slaver rulers that they must either surrender or suffer the same fate as astapor . 
the yunkish herald is carried into [DAENERYS] ['S] camp on a litter carried by slaves , along a road flanked by [UNSULLIED] . missandei announces the newcomer as [RAZDAL] mo eraz , one of the ruling wise masters of yunkai . [DAENERYS] meets the [WOMAN] in her pavilion , flanked by her [DRAGONS] who vie for her attention and fight over the pieces of meat she tosses to them they also snarl at [RAZDAL] when he gets too close . [RAZDAL] declares that yunkai was an ancient civilization long before the rise of [VALYRIA] and that numerous armies throughout history have tried and failed to conquer it . however [DAENERYS] is not threatened , commenting that a hard fought [BATTLE] would give her [UNSULLIED] much needed practice . [RAZDAL] tries a different tact , asserting there is no need for their factions to fight , that yunkai is willing to overlook her attack on astapor and will even provide her with the gold and ships needed to transport her army to westeros . in exchange , they ask that [DAENERYS] leave yunkai in peace . 
 [DAENERYS] makes a counter offer she will spare the lives of [RAZDAL] and the slave masters of yunkai if every slave [MEN] , women and [CHILDREN] in the city is set [FREE] , and given as much food , clothing and property as they can carry in payment for their services . she warns that if her offer is rejected , yunkai will be shown no [MERCY] . [RAZDAL] takes offense , promising that yunkai will be more of a challenge for her than astapor or qarth , and threatens her with the retribution of yunkai's powerful friends who he claims will take [GREAT] pleasure in destroying her army and enslaving the survivors . at that , drogon and his siblings roar in anger [RAZDAL] protests that he was promised safe conduct , to which [DAENERYS] counters that her [DRAGONS] made no such promise and take offense to him threatening their [MOTHER] . after the [DRAGONS] prevent his slaves from reclaiming the chests of gold he brought with him , [RAZDAL] storms out of the pavilion , muttering curses .

traveling back from the [RIVERLANDS] , a ship carrying melisandre and [GENDRY] leaves king's landing and passes through [BLACKWATER] bay . melisandre stares at the [BROKEN] wrecks of [STANNIS] ['S] fleet destroyed by the wildfire , asserting that her presence might have turned the tide of [BATTLE] . she questions [GENDRY] and is surprised to learn he is unaware of his father's real identity . as they pass by the [RED KEEP] , melisandre reveals to [GENDRY] that he is king [ROBERT BARATHEON] ['S] bastard son . 
in the [NORTH] , on their way to the [WALL] , [BRAN] [ROBB STARK] ['S] party makes camp . osha remains distrustful of meera and jojen [REED] and reacts with horror when they mention they intend to go [BEYOND] the [WALL] . osha bluntly refuses to go , explaining that she lost her husband , who then [ROSE] from the [DEAD] and tried to [KILL] her . she rages that none of them understand what lies [BEYOND] the [WALL] and that there is nothing left for [MEN] there . 
at the camp of the [BROTHERHOOD] [WITHOUT] banners , arya , disillusioned with the [BROTHERHOOD] for selling [GENDRY] , takes an opportunity to escape and runs off into the [NIGHT] . before she gets too far , however , she is snatched up by sandor [CLEGANE] , who was lying in wait for her . 
in the [RIVERLANDS] , en route to the twins , [ROBB STARK] ['S] army is forced to make camp , their progress delayed by heavy rain . [CATELYN] warns them that the prickly [LORD] [WALDER FREY] will take the delay as a deliberate insult to him , but edmure [TULLY] points out that [WALDER FREY] is getting the [WEDDING] he wanted his sister counters that he is getting a [WEDDING] , but not the one he wanted , glaring at her son and his wife as she says so , pointing out that [WALDER FREY] wanted one of his daughters wed to a king . [ROBB STARK] retorts that edmure is the best match [HOUSE FREY] has been offered in its history . later that [NIGHT] , as [ROBB STARK] and [TALISA] prepare for bed , she tells him she is pregnant with his child . [ROBB STARK] is gladdened by the news . 
at his prison , theon [GREYJOY] is released from the cross to which he is chained by [TWO] beautiful girls . the women lay theon down on a bed and then proceed to dramatically seduce him . they say repeatedly that they have heard that the heir to pyke is well endowed and are hoping to get [FIRST] [HAND] experience . theon is distrustful at [FIRST] , fearing that this is another of his tormenter's tricks . theon can not help himself but be aroused when one of the women who has become naked straddles him and begins a rocking motion . suddenly , the familiar horn sounds and the [BOY] enters . theon is terrified and tries to escape , but is struck hard on the head and is flung to the ground . the [BOY] claims he too has heard about theon's famous body part and announces it must very well be his favorite body part . when the sadistic youth brandishes an odd knife , theon realizes the [BOY] means to remove his penis . horrified , theon begs for [MERCY] , but the [BOY] quips that this is [MERCY] as he's not killing theon , merely altering him . [TWO] large [MEN] hold a screaming theon down while the [BOY] moves in to castrate him . 
at king's landing , neither sansa or [TYRION] are particularly happy about their impending marriage . [MARGAERY] [TYRELL] consoles sansa , reminding her that [TYRION] is far from the worst [LANNISTER] and that [TYRION] might be able to make her happy , given his skill as a lover . [BRONN] , meanwhile , points out to [TYRION] that he can easily wed sansa and get a son and heir from her to placate his father and [RED KEEP] having sex with shae in private , thereby getting [TWO] women and a kingdom to rule for himself . however , [TYRION] is concerned his mistress isn't going to be so willing to go along with that plan and is less than enthusiastic about having a wife , a mistress and the entire [NORTH] despising him . [BRONN] points out that [TYRION] is wasting his time trying to be universally loved . [TYRION] ['S] fears prove accurate as shae bluntly tells him that she will no longer sleep with him after he weds sansa . 
meanwhile , [TYWIN LANNISTER] enters the [THRONE] room to answer a summons from king [JOFFREY] . after exchanging some false courtesy [TYWIN LANNISTER] asks why his grandson wished to see him . [JOFFREY] wants an update on what the small council has been doing . [TYWIN LANNISTER] informs [JOFFREY] that the king can attend any small council meeting should he desire it . the [BOY] king claims that he is too busy to attend said meetings and demands to know why the location of the council meetings has changed . [TYWIN LANNISTER] says that he is holding the meeting in the [TOWER] of the [HAND] to save time . when [JOFFREY] complains that he would have to [CLIMB] too many steps should he wish to sit in on a small council meeting , [TYWIN LANNISTER] silently ascends the steps to stand next to the [THRONE] , silently glares down at [JOFFREY] , and then sardonically says he could arrange to have [JOFFREY] carried . a disconcerted [JOFFREY] changes the subject to [DAENERYS] [TARGARYEN] [TYWIN LANNISTER] is surprised that [JOFFREY] even knows about the exiled princess . [TYWIN LANNISTER] admits the reports are apparently true that the last [TARGARYEN] is not only alive , but has successfully hatched the [FIRST] live [DRAGONS] the world has seen in almost [TWO] centuries . [JOFFREY] is puzzled at why [TYWIN LANNISTER] doesn't think they should do anything about her , but [TYWIN LANNISTER] reminds [JOFFREY] that the last [TARGARYEN] [DRAGONS] were stunted inbred creatures who weren't a threat to anyone , and [DAENERYS]' [DRAGONS] are probably just curiosities at best , not grand weapons of war . moreover , [TYWIN LANNISTER] says that even if [DAENERYS]' [DRAGONS] do turn out to be as strong as the [DRAGONS] of centuries long ago , they are on the far side of the world and no threat to [JOFFREY] ['S] rule . [TYWIN LANNISTER] also warns his grandson that he should heed his advisor's council on matters he does not comprehend . when [JOFFREY] protests that he hasn't been counseled on anything , [TYWIN LANNISTER] says he is being advised at this very moment and says that he will inform [JOFFREY] should he deem it necessary . before taking his leave [TYWIN LANNISTER] smiles slightly with an even slighter bow leaving a browbeaten [JOFFREY] squirming on the [IRON THRONE] . their exchange leaves no doubt as to who is really ruling the kingdom . 
at [HARRENHAL] , [JAIME] speaks one last time to brienne before he leaves . [JAIME] remarks that he owes brienne a debt for both keeping him alive on their journey and for giving him a reason to live to rouse him from his suicidal depression after losing his [HAND] . brienne tells [JAIME] to repay his debt by keeping his pledge . [JAIME] promises that he will [RED KEEP] his word to return [CATELYN STARK] ['S] daughters to her . 
the next day , [JAIME] leaves [HARRENHAL] in the company of qyburn who is to accompany [JAIME] to continue treating his arm in the hopes of getting his maester's chain restored through [LORD] [TYWIN LANNISTER] ['S] influence [JAIME] jokes that his father will make qyburn grand maester if he grows [JAIME] a [NEW] [HAND] and a number of [BOLTON] soldiers under the command of steelshanks , one of [LORD] [BOLTON] ['S] captains . [LORD] [ROOSE BOLTON] , who is also about to depart [HARRENHAL] for the twins , under orders from [ROBB STARK] , requests that [JAIME] pass on his regards to [TYWIN LANNISTER] [JAIME] asks that [ROOSE BOLTON] do the same for him with [ROBB STARK] . locke , who has been left in charge of the [CASTLE] in [ROOSE BOLTON] ['S] absence , can't resist poking fun at the departing [JAIME] and sneers that he will'take good care' of brienne , though [JAIME] doesn't rise to the bait . 
when their party makes camp , as qyburn checks [JAIME] ['S] stump , [JAIME] questions how the former maester lost his chain . qyburn explains that he lost it for performing vivisections on the sick and dying in a bid to better understand illness . [JAIME] is disgusted by this revelation , but qyburn counters what he learned has saved numerous more lives and questions [JAIME] on how many he has killed compared to how many he's saved . [JAIME] responds that he has probably killed thousands , but he saved half a million lives when he killed the mad king to save the population of king's landing , much to qyburn's surprise . 
 [JAIME] then asks about brienne qyburn confirms that they sent a raven to her father , [LORD] [SELWYN] [TARTH] , and he offered a ransom of 300 gold [DRAGONS] for his daughter's safe return . however , locke refused the offer still under the misapprehension that [TARTH] owns every sapphire mine in westeros , locke is convinced [LORD] [SELWYN] is trying to cheat him . when qyburn mentions that most of the [MEN] would rather get some meager entertainment out of killing brienne before they [DIE] in [BATTLE] or [WINTER] , [JAIME] , feeling guilty because his lie to protect brienne has invertantly placed her in greater danger , urges steelshanks to return to [HARRENHAL] . though the [MAN] initially refuses , [JAIME] uses the promise of a reward and the threat of [TYWIN LANNISTER] ['S] retribution to convince him to go back . 
upon arriving at [HARRENHAL] , [JAIME] is shocked and furious to find locke and his cronies have thrown brienne into a [BEAR] pit , facing an angry [BEAR] with only a wooden sword to defend herself , as they all mockingly sing the [BEAR] and the [MAIDEN FAIR] . [JAIME] orders locke to pull her out and offers to pay whatever ransom he wants , but locke dismisses the offer , getting more satisfaction out of the spectacle of brienne being torn apart . in desperation , [JAIME] leaps into the pit to help her before the [BEAR] can harm either of them , steelshanks shoots it with a crossbow , distracting the beast long enough for [JAIME] and brienne to be pulled out of the pit . locke tries to stop them from leaving , but [JAIME] angrily tells him that [LORD] [ROOSE BOLTON] cares more about getting him back to king's landing alive than keeping one of his pet thugs happy , and backed up by steelshanks and his [MEN] , locke is unable to stop them . [JAIME] then departs [HARRENHAL] with his escort and brienne in tow .

 [DAENERYS] , [JORAH] and [BARRISTAN] hide behind a ruined building to spy on the encampment of the [SECOND SONS] , a professional mercenary company , the powerful friends the yunkish have employed .

arya [STARK] , now a captive of sandor [CLEGANE] after he kidnapped her from the [BROTHERHOOD] [WITHOUT] banners , picks up a rock and stands over him planning to strike . she thinks he is sound asleep . he opens his eyes and tells her she has one chance to hit him , and [KILL] him , but if she fails he will break her hands . later she sits on the horse with him sullen and refusing food he offers her . sandor points out that for all she hates him , arya could have been taken captive by someone far worse . he tells her about sansa and how he rescued her from a group of would be rapists . arya disbelieves this , but sandor says ask your sister if you ever see her again . they arrive at a river which arya initially thinks to be the [BLACKWATER] . rather confused with her lack of understanding he points out that the river is the [RED] fork of the trident . arya believed he was taking her back to king's landing , but he reveals that he is in fact taking her to the twins , where her [MOTHER] and brother will shortly be attending her uncle's [WEDDING] , and he will ransom her to them . he tells her ruefully that if she wasn't so busy trying to [KILL] him they might make it in time for the [WEDDING] . arya has a small and hidden smile as the hound spurs the horse to a gallop . 
melisandre finally arrives back at dragonstone with [GENDRY] in tow . [STANNIS] is less than impressed by the sight of the bastard [BOY] who is technically his nephew and is bemused when melisandre orders him fed , bathed and clothed . he believes it is pointless as they intend to sacrifice him , but melisandre reveals it is merely a sham to [KEEP] [GENDRY] feeling secure , in much the same way as keeping a sacrificial lamb from seeing the blade of the knife . 
meanwhile , [DAVOS] seaworth , still languishing in his cell , is paid a visit by [STANNIS] [DAVOS] is told of the impending sacrifice of [GENDRY] . [DAVOS] protests this saying that unlike [RENLY] who was a rebel against his rightful king , [GENDRY] is an innocent who has [NEVER] done him any wrong . [STANNIS] argues that the sacrifice of one bastard [BOY] will usher in his victory , which [STANNIS] believes is the only way to save every [MAN] , [WOMAN] and child in westeros from the [COMING] darkness that will devour everything in its path . he asks how [DAVOS] can doubt the power of melisandre's god when [STANNIS] has seen visions of a [GREAT] [BATTLE] in the [SNOW] and [DAVOS] saw the creature she gave birth to . [DAVOS] speculates that the real reason [STANNIS] came is because deep down , a part of him knows what he's about to do is wrong and he knew [DAVOS] would tell him the truth he needs to hear , regardless of how it would be taken . after extracting a promise from [DAVOS] that he won't act against melisandre again , [STANNIS] has him released . 
 [STANNIS] naming the 3 usurpers . 
in [GENDRY] ['S] quarters , melisandre seduces [GENDRY] long enough to distract him , then promptly ties him to the bed and places leeches on his body . she explains as [STANNIS] and [DAVOS] enter the room that [DAVOS] wanted a demonstration of the power in king's [BLOOD] , then removes the leeches and lights a [FIRE] in a nearby brazier . as part of the magical ritual that follows , [STANNIS] throws the leeches into the flames at melisandre's direction , and recites the names of three people he wants [DEAD] as they burn the usurper [ROBB STARK] , the usurper [BALON GREYJOY] , the usurper [JOFFREY BARATHEON] . 
at king's landing , [TYRION] speaks with sansa before their [WEDDING] at the [GREAT SEPT] of [BAELOR] though he knows the girl is not thrilled at the prospect of marrying him . [TYRION] promises sansa that he will not mistreat her , and sansa agrees there are worse [LANNISTERS] she could be wed to . prior to the [WEDDING] , [MARGAERY] [TYRELL] tries to ingratiate herself to [CERSEI] , commenting they will technically be sisters soon [CERSEI] responds by telling [MARGAERY] the story behind the [RAINS] of [CASTAMERE] , relating how it refers to the destruction of [HOUSE] reyne of [CASTAMERE] after their failed rebellion against [HOUSE LANNISTER] inferring similarities between the ambitions and position of [HOUSES] reyne and [TYRELL] and that the same fate [MAY] fall upon [HOUSE TYRELL] if they plot against the [LANNISTERS] and concludes by threatening to have [MARGAERY] strangled in her sleep if she ever dares call [CERSEI] sister again . the ceremony is a grim affair [JOFFREY BARATHEON] smugly escorts sansa to the altar in place of her father and petulantly removes the stool upon which [TYRION] was to stand on to cloak sansa in [HOUSE LANNISTER] colors as part of the ceremony , eliciting snickers from the congregation though the scowl of [LORD] [TYWIN] quickly silences them . [TYRION] in the face of humiliation asks sansa to kneel and he places the cloak around her shoulders . the [NEW] [HIGH] septon begins the ceremony . later as [WOMAN] and wife they have their reception dinner , which also proves a grim and miserable affair . 
tyrions threatens [JOFFREY BARATHEON] . 
 [TYRION] spends the [WEDDING] feast mostly by getting deeply drunk and making light of his father's insistence that his inebriated state will render him unfit to impregnate his wife . [TYRION] , drunkenly proclaiming himself the god of tits and wine , reminds his father that [TYWIN] has long called him a drunken little lust filled beast , so doing his duty in the marriage bed will not pose a problem . at the same time , [JOFFREY BARATHEON] is himself drinking too much wine , and losing what few inhibitions he has , his behavior becomes increasingly offensive to both sansa and [TYRION] . against [CERSEI] ['S] ineffectual protests , [JOFFREY BARATHEON] gets up and , flanked by his [KINGSGUARD] , taunts sansa that she's still found a way to marry a [HOUSE LANNISTER] . [JOFFREY BARATHEON] then ponders that it doesn't matter which [HOUSE LANNISTER] gets her pregnant , and openly says he might want to rape her after [TYRION] is done with her , while the [KINGSGUARD] hold her down . 
 [JOFFREY BARATHEON] then declares it time for the bedding ceremony which involves the [MEN] at the [WEDDING] stripping the bride and the women stripping the groom before carrying them off to the marriage bed but [TYRION] angrily insists there will be no bedding ceremony . when [JOFFREY BARATHEON] keeps pushing the matter , [TYRION] slams his dagger into the table and threatens that [JOFFREY BARATHEON] will be fucking his own bride with a wooden cock if he doesn't let it drop . as the court stands in shocked silence , [JOFFREY BARATHEON] seethes with outrage and [TYRION] defiantly glares at his nephew with pure hatred . after a tense moment , [TYWIN] defuses the situation by agreeing that there will be no bedding ceremony , and placates [JOFFREY BARATHEON] by claiming [TYRION] ['S] outburst is merely the result of his being extremely drunk . taking the hint , [TYRION] visibly swallows his anger and begins to act far more drunk than he actually is , intentionally humiliating himself , and says he only made a bad joke . it isn't clear if anyone in the room , including [TYWIN] or [JOFFREY BARATHEON] , think that [TYRION] ['S] outburst was simply due to being very drunk , but everyone plays along anyway to help the tension pass . [TYRION] , while pretending to be so drunk he can barely stand , escorts sansa to their bedchamber . 
once they are alone in their quarters , a tense moment passes as sansa nervously and slowly undresses . [TYRION] ultimately tells her to stop , deciding that he will not consummate the marriage if she does not want to , and only will if she changes her mind . when sansa questions what he will do if she [NEVER] does , [TYRION] sarcastically jokes and so my [WATCH] begins implying that his marriage will be celibate for all time like a brother of the [NIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] and then abruptly passes out on a nearby couch . the following morning , shae notices with a hint of a smile that sansa's bed sheets are not stained with [BLOOD] and [TYRION] ['S] virgin bride is still a virgin .

 [SAM] tells gilly about a way to get through the [WALL] . 
 [SAM] tells gilly that they are a considerable distance west of [CASTLE BLACK] , but this isn't a problem , because this means they are close to the [NIGHTFORT] , the original headquarters of the [NIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] , which was abandoned centuries ago as the organization's numbers dwindled .

at the twins , the carnage at the [RED WEDDING] continues to unfold . while the northern lords are being slaughtered in the main [HALL] , outside the walls of the [CASTLE] [HOUSE FREY] soldiers ambush the [ROBB STARK] army in its own camp . what follows is not a [BATTLE] but a one sided massacre as the northern army is taken completely by surprise due to the betrayal of their supposed allies . the betrayers torch all of the camp's tents , with many [MEN] burning alive inside of them . [HOUSE FREY] [MEN] wildly mutilate the [DEAD] and dying . from one of the twin towers of the [HOUSE FREY] stronghold , [ROOSE BOLTON] watches the massacre . 
 [ROBB STARK] ['S] corpse desecrated , with his direwolf's head sewn in place of his own . 
sandor [CLEGANE] attempts to slip away amidst the carnage on a horse , along with the unconscious arya [ROBB STARK] , by casually riding away while carrying a [HOUSE FREY] banner . before they can leave , arya regains consciousness as she and the hound turn to see a group of [HOUSE FREY] [MEN] shouting as they march through the main gate . the freys have horrifically desecrated [ROBB STARK] ['S] corpse by decapitating it , then crudely attaching the severed head of his direwolf grey wind in its place . drunk with victory , the freys gleefully parade the mutilated body around the [CASTLE] on a horse while mockingly chanting king in the [NORTH] king in the [NORTH] here he comes , the king in the [NORTH] , which is met with by cheers and peals of laughter from the crowds of [HOUSE FREY] soldiers . 
sandor is horrified by the gruesome spectacle , while he holds arya , who looks on with a [DEAD] stare . the hound rides away with her , undisturbed thanks to the [HOUSE FREY] banner in his [HAND] . 
in the [GREAT] [HALL] of the [CASTLE] the following morning , as servants clean up the pools of [BLOOD] left by their former [RED WEDDING] guests , lords [WALDER FREY] and [ROOSE BOLTON] gloat over their victory and the rewards their treachery has won them . [WALDER FREY] will become [LORD] of riverrun , and the freys will replace the tullys as the [LANNISTERS]' vassals in the [RIVERLANDS] . [ROOSE BOLTON] has been appointed as the [NEW] warden of the [NORTH] , replacing the [STARKS] though [TYWIN LANNISTER] intends to eventually give the position to a future [TYWIN LANNISTER] heir produced by [TYRION] [TYWIN LANNISTER] and sansa [ROBB STARK] . 
 [ROOSE BOLTON] expresses his concern that brynden [HOUSE TULLY] escaped the massacre , but [WALDER FREY] dismisses his worries , pointing out that the blackfish and the remaining [HOUSE TULLY] garrison at riverrun is alone and outnumbered against the combined strength of the [LANNISTERS] , [BOLTONS] , and freys , although [ROOSE BOLTON] is still visibly concerned . [ROOSE BOLTON] makes plain his contempt for [ROBB STARK] , considering the late [BOY] king arrogant , politically incompetent , and unwilling to take [ROOSE BOLTON] ['S] advice and make the hard decisions needed to [TYWIN LANNISTER] . [WALDER FREY] questions [ROOSE BOLTON] if he intends to rule the [NORTH] from [WINTERFELL] , and he says that he might move his ruling seat there at some future time , after it is rebuilt . this leads [WALDER FREY] to ask how [WINTERFELL] [ENDED] up a ruin . [ROOSE BOLTON] explains that his bastard son [RAMSAY SNOW] offered [ROBB STARK] ['S] terms that the ironborn occupiers would be shown [MERCY] if they handed over theon [GREYJOY] , but when they did they learned that [RAMSAY SNOW] , in his father's [WORDS] , has his own way of doing [THINGS] . 
at the dreadfort , [RAMSAY SNOW] eats his breakfast of a thick sausage , taunting theon about his recent emasculation by pointing to his sewn up and [BLOOD] stained trousers , and laughing as theon finally begs for death as a release from the nightmare . [RAMSAY SNOW] tells him that he is more valuable alive than [DEAD] so the answer must be no . [RAMSAY SNOW] notes that theon reeks , and decides that that shall be his [NEW] [NAME] reek . theon refuses to acknowledge the [NAME] , twice insisting that he is theon [GREYJOY] , but after [RAMSAY SNOW] beats him , he finally breaks down and says his [NAME] is reek . 
on pyke , [BALON GREYJOY] reads a message from [LORD] [ROOSE BOLTON] ['S] bastard while his daughter yara [BALON GREYJOY] cautiously opens a box crudely carved with the [BALON GREYJOY] kraken . as [RAMSAY SNOW] ['S] letter explains the box contains theon's favorite toy . the message bluntly says that the ironborn have until the full moon to withdraw from the [NORTH] or receive more bits and pieces of theon . in addition any remaining ironborn will be flayed alive just as [RAMSAY SNOW] flayed alive theon's twenty ironborn followers at [WINTERFELL] after they surrendered , even though he had promised them safe passage . it was in fact [RAMSAY SNOW] and his soldiers from [HOUSE BOLTON] who burned [WINTERFELL] to the ground he simply sent false reports for his father [ROOSE BOLTON] to deliver to [ROBB STARK] which claimed that the ironborn were responsible , as the [BOLTONS] were preparing to betray the [STARKS] months before the [RED WEDDING] . 
 [BALON GREYJOY] acts indifferent to theon's situation since he defied [BALON GREYJOY] ['S] orders and yara's common sense when he stayed at [WINTERFELL] . furthermore , he can not further the [BALON GREYJOY] line as the contents of the box prove . however , yara does not share her father's attitude toward her last living brother . she announces her intention to take her fastest ship with her fifty best [MEN] , sail around westeros , besiege the dreadfort , and liberate theon . 
in the [RIVERLANDS] , a despondent arya [ROBB STARK] and sandor [CLEGANE] ride away from the outskirts of the twins . they pass close to a small group of [WALDER FREY] [MEN] , one of whom is bragging about being one of the [MEN] who cut off grey wind's head and attached it to [ROBB STARK] ['S] body . arya approaches them and sweetly asks to warm herself by the [FIRE] . she offers the coin given to her by jaqen h'ghar as payment . when the [WALDER FREY] [MAN] investigates , she stabs him in the [NECK] . slightly thrown , the hound deals with the others before demanding to know where arya got the knife . she reveals it's his . he admonishes her to let him know the next time she plans to do something like that . as he grumbles and cleans up the bodies , arya whispers , [VALAR MORGHULIS] . 
meanwhile , in king's landing , [TYRION] [TYWIN LANNISTER] and sansa [ROBB STARK] [WALK] through the [GARDENS] . a pair of passing gentlemen snigger at [TYRION] , either for his dwarf status or due to rumors he has not consummated his marriage . sansa tells him to pay them no mind . [TYRION] reminds sansa that he's used to it , as he's always been a dwarf . he also states that he's not [JOFFREY] , [TYRION] would rather bide his time and humiliate them . sansa playfully follows his line of thinking , and suggests sheep shifting secretly hiding sheep's dung deep within a mattress as arya used to do to her , so that the target always wakes up smelling of dung . [TYRION] is amused but is confused by the term , though he realizes belatedly that sansa has misheard the word shit . he is rescued from having to explain his wife's mistake by podrick [PAYNE] , who calls him to a meeting of the small council . 
in [TYWIN LANNISTER] ['S] chambers grand maester [PYCELLE] dithers over giving [TYRION] a coded message from [LORD] [JOFFREY] . [JOFFREY] jubilantly explains its meaning that [ROBB STARK] and [CATELYN STARK] are both [DEAD] . [TYRION] is visibly startled by the news , already foreseeing the long term problems that the incident will cause , but [JOFFREY] brushes him off and gleefully states that he intends to serve [ROBB STARK] ['S] severed head to sansa at his [RED WEDDING] feast . none of the small council are able to mask how distasteful they find the concept . [VARYS] points out that sansa is [JOFFREY] ['S] aunt by marriage now and it would be unseemly not to give her the basic respect that accords . 
a deeply embarrassed [CERSEI] forces a smile and insists to the rest of the council that [JOFFREY] was only joking and did not mean it . this puzzles [JOFFREY] , who matter of factly states to his [MOTHER] that he did mean it , and he will have [ROBB STARK] ['S] head served at his [RED WEDDING] feast . [TYRION] flatly forbids it and tells [JOFFREY] that sansa isn't his to torment anymore . [JOFFREY] angrily proclaims that he is the king , and everyone is his to torment . [TYWIN LANNISTER] counters that a king who has to remind his subjects that he is the king , is no king . [JOFFREY] goes apoplectic and tries to fight his grandfather , deriding [TYWIN LANNISTER] as a coward who hid under casterly rock while [JOFFREY] ['S] father king [ROBERT] won the real war when he overthrew the targaryens . the entire small council tenses waiting for [TYWIN LANNISTER] to respond to this shocking insult instead [TYWIN LANNISTER] coldly and calmly declares that the king is tired and advises the queen regent to see him to bed . [JOFFREY] weakly protests that he is not tired but leaves with his [MOTHER] , and [TYWIN LANNISTER] also asks [PYCELLE] to give his grandson a sedative to make sure he goes to sleep . 
 [TYWIN LANNISTER] dismisses the rest of the council , save [TYRION] , who drily notes that the [LORD] of the [SEVEN KINGDOMS] has been sent to bed [WITHOUT] his supper . he confronts [TYWIN LANNISTER] about his part in the [RED WEDDING] , and deduces that his father must have orchestrated it , as [WALDER FREY] is not brave enough to have carried it out on his own . the [HAND] blithely confirms this . he dismisses [TYRION] ['S] concerns that the northerners will [NEVER] forget nor forgive such an outrage , arguing he wants them to remember so that it will make them wary of rebelling again . [TYRION] shows his distaste for [TYWIN LANNISTER] ['S] choice of a [RED WEDDING] as the place to inflict the slaughter , but [TYWIN LANNISTER] responds , asking why killing ten thousand soldiers in [BATTLE] is nobler than killing a dozen guests at a [RED WEDDING] . 
 [TYWIN LANNISTER] again waxes poetic about family , noting [TYRION] ['S] failure to consummate his marriage to sansa . [TYRION] refuses to force himself on sansa to do his duty , and notes that she is hardly likely to warm to him now that the [LANNISTERS] have murdered her [MOTHER] and brother . [TYRION] demands to know when [TYWIN LANNISTER] ever put the family's interests above his own . [TYWIN LANNISTER] retorts that he did exactly that on the day that [TYRION] was born he wanted to throw his newborn son into the sea , but instead he spared him and raised him as his son , because he is a [TYWIN LANNISTER] . 
immediately after leaving , [TYRION] returns to his chambers and calls for sansa , who simply regards him with a forlorn , tear streaked face confirming that she was already informed of her family's death . [TYRION] backs out , knowing that his sympathy would be rather cold comfort . 
elsewhere in the [RED KEEP] , [VARYS] meets with shae . he tells her that he knows she is genuinely in love with [TYRION] and that is why she should take the diamonds he offers her and leave immediately for essos to build a [NEW] , lavish life for herself . [VARYS] is convinced that [TYRION] is the last hope for the [SEVEN KINGDOMS]' current regime , therefore shae is a weakness that [TYRION] , and thus the realm , can not afford . shae confirms that she is in love with [TYRION] and that she cares deeply for sansa as well , but in spite of her pain at seeing them together and the danger she poses , shae will not leave until or unless [TYRION] asks her to . 
unknown to everyone in king's landing , [JAIME] [TYWIN LANNISTER] , brienne of [TARTH] , and qyburn finally arrive the city [FOLK] do not even recognize [JAIME] after his long absence from the capital . they make their way to the [RED KEEP] , where [JAIME] immediately calls on [CERSEI] , who regards him with a confused look as she takes in his disheveled appearance and missing [HAND] . 
at dragonstone , ser [DAVOS] seaworth tests his [NEW] found literacy on [STANNIS BARATHEON] ['S] correspondence , declining [SHIREEN] [STANNIS BARATHEON] ['S] invitation to read more tales of aegon i [TARGARYEN] . he expresses dissatisfaction about the odd spelling of the word [NIGHT] , before hearing the horns that signal melisandre's intents to sacrifice [GENDRY] . he argues with [STANNIS BARATHEON] again about sacrificing the [BOY] , but [STANNIS BARATHEON] is convinced by melisandre that using [GENDRY] as part of her [BLOOD] magic will give him the power to destroy his enemies and claim the [IRON THRONE] . when he doesn't get through to his liege , [DAVOS] takes matters into his own hands and frees the [BOY] , giving him a rowboat and directions to king's landing . a furious [STANNIS BARATHEON] sentences [DAVOS] to death but the [ONION KNIGHT] produces a letter from the [ONION KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] . [DAVOS] insists that it is [STANNIS BARATHEON]' duty to assist the [BLACK] brothers , and that he will need [DAVOS] ['S] assistance to rally troops and mercenaries . melisandre burns the letter and acknowledges the truth the war of the five kings is irrelevant . the true war lies in the [NORTH] , and evil and death are marching on the [WALL] . she also agrees that [DAVOS] has an important role to play in the events to [COME] . [STANNIS BARATHEON] sarcastically laughs at r'hllor's sense of humor , noting that the god [DAVOS] likes to mock has chosen him for a higher purpose .

[RAMSAY SNOW] , knowing how close theon was to [ROBB STARK] , gleefully taunts him by revealing details of the [RED WEDDING] , particularly relishing the fact that it was [ROOSE BOLTON] who personally murdered [ROBB STARK] . despite being clearly shaken to know the [MAN] he considered a brother is [DEAD] at the hands of his [NEW] masters , theon does not openly react . 
 [ROOSE BOLTON] dispatches locke with orders to find and [KILL] [BRAN] and rickon reek suggests that [JON SNOW] might either be sheltering the boys at [CASTLE BLACK] or at least [MAY] know where they have gone , while [RAMSAY SNOW] advocates killing [JON SNOW] as well , given that the fact he has [ROBB STARK] [BLOOD] could lead to him becoming a threat , since the northeners will rally behind him or he will simply seek revenge although harming [JON SNOW] would constitute a grave crime since he is part of the [NIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] and thus legally untouchable by the [SEVEN KINGDOMS] . [ROOSE BOLTON] gives [RAMSAY SNOW] orders as well to take theon and an army to moat cailin and reclaim the fortress from the greyjoys . if he succeeds , [ROOSE BOLTON] will give consideration to legitimizing [RAMSAY SNOW] as a member of [HOUSE BOLTON] .

[JOFFREY] accepts the [GIFT] but his sincerity seems questionable . a member of the [KINGSGUARD] then presents a valyrian steel sword and [TYWIN LANNISTER] tells him that it is one of [TWO SWORDS] of its kind in the capital , and [JOFFREY] rushes to wield it . he promptly begins to slash at [TYRION] ['S] [GIFT] despite its rarity , and then asks for suggestions on its [NAME] from guests in attendance . he settle on the [NAME] widow's wail .

[LORAS] leaves in anger after watching the crude depiction of his deceased lover [RENLY] riding a mount resembling [LORAS] , and sansa looks on in obvious grief when the dwarf playing her brother [ROBB STARK] is killed after having his [WOLF] ['S] head knocked off . [JOFFREY] expresses his delight with the play and prepares to give the champion dwarf a purse but then mockingly suggests that [TYRION] fight him as well . [TYRION] cleverly counters this jape by suggesting that [JOFFREY] should fight instead and show the same bravery he displayed at the [BATTLE] of the [BLACKWATER] , cautioning his nephew to be careful as the champion dwarf is clearly mad with lust and it would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his [RED WEDDING] [NIGHT] . this draws a few stifled chuckles from their guests . enraged and humiliated that his uncle outwitted him in front of all his [RED WEDDING] guests , [JOFFREY] petulantly pours wine over [TYRION] ['S] head and orders him to serve him wine as his cupbearer . 
 [TYRION] approaches [JOFFREY] , who then purposely drops the goblet and kicks it under the table . sansa hands the goblet to [TYRION] , and he fills it with wine and hands it back to [JOFFREY] . the king demands that [TYRION] kneel before him but [TYRION] refuses . [MARGAERY] interrupts the tense moment and says it is time to cut the pigeon pie .

in the last hours before his trial by combat , [TYRION] and [JAIME] share a final drink in [TYRION] ['S] cell and reminisce about orson [TYWIN LANNISTER] , their simple minded cousin who spent his days smashing beetles with a rock . [TYRION] tells [JAIME] of how he used to observe orson day after day in an attempt to understand his motives , but in the [END] he was [NEVER] able to [COME] to reach any understanding . [TYRION] asks [JAIME] if he thinks [OBERYN] stands a chance , but [JAIME] is not optimistic . as a bell rings out to announce daybreak in the city , [JAIME] takes his leave , wishing his brother luck . 
 [TYWIN LANNISTER] guardsmen escort [TYRION] to the arena , where a large crowd has assembled . he grows apprehensive to find a helm less [OBERYN] drinking , and wearing very light armor in comparison to his opponent , ser [GREGOR CLEGANE] , clad from head to foot in heavy armor and wielding a greatsword . [OBERYN] dismisses [TYRION] ['S] concerns , noting that he always drinks before a fight and favors speed over protection . as [GREGOR CLEGANE] and his squire make their way to the arena , ellaria becomes concerned , noting that the [MOUNTAIN] is the biggest [WOMAN] she's ever seen , but [OBERYN] remains confident that he will emerge triumphant . grand maester [PYCELLE] steps into the arena and begins making a long winded speech asking the [GODS] to favor the innocent before [TYWIN LANNISTER] cuts him short and begins the trial by combat .

 [JON] and [SAM] are standing [WATCH] atop the [WALL] , staring out into the darkness of the [NORTH] and awaiting the imminent wildling invasion . [SAM] attempts to interrogate [JON] about what it was like to be with a [WOMAN] , stating that as their deaths are likely imminent , it [MAY] be his last chance to find out . [SAM] brings up that the vows of the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] only explicitly forbid members from taking wives or producing [CHILDREN] , and that other activities are open to interpretation . [JON] replies glumly that [ALLISER THORNE] most likely does not care about their interpretations . when further pressed by [SAM] to describe lying down with ygritte , [JON] attempts to explain but is unable to properly express it , proclaiming exasperatedly that he's not a bleeding poet . 
 [JON] offers to take the [WATCH] up alone so [SAM] can go below , and as [SAM] steps into the elevator and begins to descend the [WALL] , an owl [LANDS] on top of the [WALL] and begins hooting loudly . the owl is revealed to be controlled by a thenn warg who is a member of the garrison of wildlings under command of tormund and styr , who have set up camp just outside of the southern entrance to [CASTLE BLACK] . tormund boasts about a [BEAR] he supposedly had sex with , prompting ygritte to cut him short and cast her doubts on the validity of his claim . she tells him that she only cares about getting as many arrows through the hearts of crows as possible . she angrily talks about how the people south of the [WALL] shut the the wildlings out by building it and hunting the wildlings as enemies she says that now the wildlings are the hunters and the southerners their prey . styr mockingly replies that ygritte has more [WORDS] about killing than she has arrows . she defends herself by saying she killed just as many people at mole's town as he , but styr replies that none of them was her former lover . he further mocks her by saying that when she sees him , she'll likely just serve him a slice of ginger minge , causing her to jump to her feet in anger . ygritte stares styr down , claiming that she wants to [KILL] [JON SNOW] herself , then looks around the camp and warns the others that she has an arrow ready for anyone else who attempts to [KILL] him . just outside the camp , a shaded person cradling something passes by the wildlings unnoticed . 
maester [AEMON] finds [SAM] in the [CASTLE BLACK] library . meanwhile , [SAM] is caught reading a [BOOK] about wildlings by maester [AEMON] . [AEMON] correctly guesses that [SAM] is reading the [BOOK] because he wants to know what kind of fate might have befallen gilly if she fell into wildling hands during the sack of mole's town . he also surmises that [SAM] has shown such a keen interest in her fate because he is in love with her , despite [SAM] ['S] protests to the contrary . [AEMON] muses about the girl he once loved , stating that he can still picture her as clear as day and that she is more real than [SAM] is . after being dismissed by [AEMON] , [SAM] leaves the maester's chambers only to hear gilly at the gate begging to be allowed inside , revealing her survival of the mole's town massacre and her identity as the cloaked figure approaching [CASTLE BLACK] . pypar attempts to deny her passage into the [CASTLE BLACK] , saying he is not allowed to open the gate under any circumstances . however , [SAM] roars at pyp to allow her in , causing pyp to relent and let her in . [SAM] promises gilly wherever she goes next he will go too , but their reunion is cut short by [TWO] blows from the horn , indicating that mance's wildling army has finally begun their assault . [SAM] rushes to get gilly safely inside the [CASTLE BLACK] while other brothers of the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] prepare for the imminent attack by wildlings . 
 [JON SNOW] looking off the top of the [WALL] . 
on top of the [WALL] , [JON SNOW] hears the horn blowing and looks [NORTH] , witnessing a tremendous conflagration to the [NORTH] , just as mance had promised . south of the [WALL] , the thenn warg's owl also spots the [FIRE] and informs styr and tormund that the time has [COME] to attack [CASTLE BLACK] . [JON SNOW] approaches ser [ALLISER THORNE] , who finally relents and admits that they should have heeded [JON SNOW] ['S] advice and blocked the gates . he grimly muses that leadership often means being [SECOND] guessed by every clever little twat with a mouth and when a [WOMAN] in charge [SECOND] guesses himself , all is doomed . steeling himself for the impending siege , [ALLISER THORNE] begins barking orders to the archers , preparing them to [FIRE] upon the attackers massing below . 
 [SAM] and gilly share a kiss . [SAM] brings gilly and her baby to a storage room where she can hide . gilly wants [SAM] to stay with her as he promised , but he can not as he swore to defend the [WALL] as a brother of the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] . before he leaves her , gilly begs [SAM] to promise her that he won't [DIE] and the [TWO] finally share a kiss . as [SAM] and pypar are preparing arrows at the southern gate , pypar laments that he has [NEVER] seen a real [BATTLE] before or ever even held an edged blade . pypar asks how [SAM] is not afraid , but [SAM] replies that he is , as there are thousands of wildlings about to overrun them . pypar asks how he managed to [KILL] a [WHITE] walker while being afraid , and [SAM] says that at that moment , he just had to do something or gilly would have been killed and her baby would have been taken . [SAM] further explains that at that moment , he wasn't himself he was nothing , and when you are nothing there is nothing to be afraid of . however , he explains the reason he is afraid now is because i'm not nothing anymore . 
. 
meanwhile , ygritte spies on the [CASTLE BLACK] to scout numbers of defenders . she tells the other wildlings that most of the guards are at the top of the [WALL] and that few are left in the [CASTLE BLACK] . the group immediately take off towards [CASTLE BLACK] ['S] southern gate , while ygritte seems to have [SECOND] thoughts . [NORTH] of the [WALL] , the massive wildling army emerges from the woods , their numbers including giants riding atop mammoths . [ALLISER THORNE] orders the archers on the [WALL] to nock their arrows , but they draw instead while grenn accidentally drops a barrel down the [WALL] . [ALLISER THORNE] angrily drills his [MEN] on properly following orders when another horn blows from down below at [CASTLE BLACK] , signalling the unanticipated appearance of tormund's band of wildlings at the [CASTLE BLACK] ['S] southern entrance . realizing the dire need for experienced [MEN] to defend the [KEEP] from the surprise attack , [ALLISER THORNE] orders janos slynt to assume command of the [WALL] ['S] defenses and heads below to join the melee . 
below , tormund and styr's forces charge the gate while ygritte , acting as a sniper , manages to pick off several [MEN] defending the gate with her bow . pypar is firing a crossbow as [SAM] assists by reloading another crossbow , but pypar's aim is poor due to inexperience and nerves and he repeatedly misses his shots . the band of wildlings manage to reach [CASTLE BLACK] ['S] walls and begin scaling them using grappling hooks and ropes , forcing [SAM] and pyp to retreat . 
 [ALLISER THORNE] arrives with reinforcements from the top of the [WALL] via the wooden lift system , which is being operated by olly . [ALLISER THORNE] gives an impassioned speech , promising that the ancient order of the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] and [CASTLE BLACK] will survive this [BATTLE] . his speech rallies the [CASTLE BLACK] brothers and [ALLISER THORNE] personally leads the charge against the wildlings who have breached [CASTLE BLACK] ['S] defenses , causing an intense [BATTLE] to erupt in the courtyard . 
on the northern side of the [WALL] , a wildling strike force led by [TWO] giants one of which is riding a mammoth charge towards [CASTLE BLACK] ['S] outer gate . on top of the [WALL] , janos slynt , having no true leadership experience , breaks down at the sight of the massive wildling army and begins fumbling his orders . grenn steps in by falsely claiming that [ALLISER THORNE] needs janos back down below . janos believes the lie and leaves , allowing [JON SNOW] to take command of the [WALL] ['S] defenses . the [CASTLE BLACK] brothers continue to rain down arrows on the advancing wildlings , even killing ones that are attempting to scale the [WALL] . one giant , armed with a massive bow , manages to [FIRE] a huge arrow at one of the bunkers atop the [WALL] , completely obliterating it and killing the [CASTLE BLACK] brother manning it the force of the giant's arrow carries the [CASTLE BLACK] brother off the [WALL] on to the other side where he is shoved into ground with a tremendous amount of force . 
hobb takes up his butcher's knife to defend the dining [HALL] . 
down in [CASTLE BLACK] , the [BATTLE] rages on between the wildlings and the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] . styr and ygritte continue to slay numerous [CASTLE BLACK] brothers . at one point , a group of wildlings breach [CASTLE BLACK] ['S] dining [HALL] . one wildling is killed when a [CASTLE BLACK] brother throws boiling stew in his face and beats him to death with the pot . hobb , [CASTLE BLACK] ['S] cook , calmly enters the dining [HALL] and kills a wildling with his massive butcher's knife . meanwhile , janos slynt cowardly retreats to a storage room where he discovers gilly and her baby .

mag mar tun doh weg charges [CASTLE BLACK] ['S] inner gate . 
the [CASTLE BLACK] brothers defending the [WALL] manage to repel most of the wildlings attacking the outer gate , but one giant manages to make it through , greatly weakening the gate by repeatedly smashing it with his fists and managing to singlehandedly begin lifting the gate . [JON SNOW] , knowing the inner gate won't hold against the massive giant , sends a group of [CASTLE BLACK] brothers led by grenn to hold it at any cost . arriving at the inner gate , hill cowers when faced by the giant charging at them , but grenn bolsters his and the others courage by reciting the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] oath . the [CASTLE BLACK] brothers ready their weapons just as the giant slams himself into the inner gate . 
. 
 [SAM] arrives atop the [WALL] to ask [JON SNOW] for more [MEN] to defend the [CASTLE BLACK] , and [JON SNOW] tasks [SAM] with releasing [GHOST] from his pen to assist in the fighting . [JON SNOW] descends the [WALL] and finally enters the fray , quickly dispatching several wildlings and catching the attention of styr the [TWO] meet in a single combat . styr eventually gets the upper [HAND] by knocking longclaw away and brutally assaulting [JON SNOW] , smashing his face into an anvil and tossing him into the blacksmith's forge . styr picks [JON SNOW] up and begins strangling him , but [JON SNOW] spits [BLOOD] in styr's face and distracts him long enough for [JON SNOW] to grab the blacksmith's hammer lying next to him and buries it in styr's skull . 
 [JON SNOW] holds a dying ygritte . upon killing styr , [JON SNOW] turns around to find ygritte pointing her bow at him with an arrow drawn . he smiles at her , causing ygritte to hesitate . before either can say anything , ygritte is shot near the heart by an arrow fired from olly , avenging the death of his father at ygritte's hands during the wildling attack on his village . [JON SNOW] holds her in his arms as she tells him that they should have [NEVER] left the cave , and they lament circumstances that prevented them from being together as she succumbs to her wound . 
tormund makes a last stand before he is subdued by [JON SNOW] and the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] . atop the [WALL] , eddison tollett , who [JON SNOW] left in command of the defenses , orders the [MEN] to drop the'scythe.' a huge section of ice suddenly falls away from the [WALL] revealing a massive anchor like blade attached to a chain that swings along the [WALL] , mowing through the wildlings attempting to [CLIMB] its face . eddison notices the wildling forces are beginning to withdraw into the haunted forest , proclaiming that they have stopped them for now , but that the wildlings still outnumber the [CASTLE BLACK] brothers 1 , 000 to 1 and that mance was simply testing their defenses . below , a heavily wounded tormund is surrounded in the courtyard but continues to fight despite being the only wildling alive in [CASTLE BLACK] . he is finally subdued by [JON SNOW] with a crossbow and taken prisoner by the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] for interrogation . [SAM] returns to gilly just like he promised and discovers janos slynt , who hid in fear during the entire [BATTLE] . against all odds , the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] have repelled mance rayder's forces for the time being .

[JON SNOW] discusses with [SAM] that he has a suicidal solution to [END] the wildling threat he plans to assassinate mance rayder , noting that he is the only thing binding the disparate wildling clans that make up the army , and his death will rob them of that purpose and leadership . [SAM] tries to talk sense into [JON SNOW] , but to no avail . as [JON SNOW] prepares to leave via [CASTLE BLACK] ['S] tunnel , they discover the bodies of the [CASTLE BLACK] brothers who held the inner gate against the giant . grenn is amongst the casualties and [JON SNOW] tells [SAM] that all bodies must be burned . before [JON SNOW] leaves , he [REMEMBERS] the promise he made to [JEOR MORMONT] and decides to leave longclaw with [SAM] .

 [JON SNOW] emerges from the outer gate of the [WALL] and begins trudging [NORTH] through the aftermath of the previous [KNIGHT] ['S] [BATTLE] towards mance rayder's war camp . [JON SNOW] eventually reaches the tree line and is quickly surrounded by wildlings , who bring him before mance , who notes that he is wearing the [CASTLE BLACK] of the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] again . mance brings [JON SNOW] inside his tent , and questions his status as a traitor . [JON SNOW] confesses that his time spent with the wildlings was all part of a plan orchestrated by qhorin halfhand to get [JON SNOW] to infiltrate mance's army , and that qhorin tricked mance into trusting [JON SNOW] by allowing [JON SNOW] to [KILL] qhorin himself in a fight . mance asks about ygritte and [JON SNOW] reveals that she died at the [BATTLE] of [CASTLE BLACK] , though not by his hands . saddened , mance proposes that they drink a toast to her memory , but [JON SNOW] is hesitant when given an unfamiliar drink . [JON SNOW] accepts after mance assures him that if he'd wanted to [KILL] [JON SNOW] , poison would be the last of his methods . mance then asks about the giant who got through the gate but [NEVER] came out , and [JON SNOW] informs mance that the giant perished attempting to breach the inner gate at the hands of his friend grenn . mance ruefully notes that the giant was named mag the mighty , and he was king of the giants , the last of a bloodline stretching back thousands of years before the [FIRST] [MEN] entered westeros , to which [JON SNOW] then glibly notes that his friend grenn was from a farm . they have another toast to mag and grenn . 
 [JON SNOW] then proposes his terms to mance mance is to turn his army around and return [HOME] . mance immediately counters that the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] is low on oil , arrows , and [MEN] , and when he sent his full force against the [WALL] the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] threw everything they had at him to repel the attack . mance guesses there are no more than 50 [MEN] left guarding [CASTLE BLACK] , but [JON SNOW] lies and insists that there are still over 1 , 000 [MEN] defending the garrison . however , mance calls [JON SNOW] ['S] bluff and reveals that after seeing how few [MEN] were defending [CASTLE BLACK] , he sent 400 [MEN] about five miles west to [CLIMB] an unmanned section of the [WALL] , and they will attack [CASTLE BLACK] ['S] weak southern side as soon as he gives the order . mance then changes his demeanor and reveals that his people have suffered enough bloodshed and that he has no intention of conquering the [LANDS] south of the [WALL] that the wildlings are moving south to seek refuge from the growing threat of the [WHITE] walkers just as those south of the [WALL] are . mance then makes his counteroffer if the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] will open the gates to the wildlings and allow them to pass through the [WALL] , no more harm will [COME] to the [CASTLE BLACK] brothers . however , if his terms are refused , his wildling army will slaughter every last member of the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] and move south by force . 
mance then notices that [JON SNOW] is eyeing a cooking knife , and quickly deduces that [JON SNOW] came to parley with mance simply so he could assassinate him . he notes that at that moment his personal guards are far enough across the room that [JON SNOW] might actually be able to [KILL] him before being cut down himself , but that [JON SNOW] must have known he would [DIE] assassinating mance . mance is shocked and questions [JON SNOW] if this is what the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] has sunk to killing a [MAN] who let him into his own tent , accepting a parley in good faith , who shared food and drink with him , and who even offered him relatively reasonable peace terms . [JON SNOW] hesitates , but before anyone can make a move , war horns are heard from outside . mance's guards safely grab [JON SNOW] during the distraction , and mance demands to know if the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] is attacking them , but [JON SNOW] admits that it's just as mance said the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] doesn't have remotely enough numbers to leave the safety of the [WALL] and attack . 
columns of heavy horse carrying hundreds of mounted cavalry charge into the wildling camp carrying the flaming stag banners of [HOUSE BARATHEON] of dragonstone , and are led by none other than [STANNIS BARATHEON] and [DAVOS] seaworth . the wildlings are caught in their own camp , resting from the [BATTLE] the [KNIGHT] before and only expecting attacks from the [WALL] , so their eastern flank is completely undefended . as they are undisciplined and have no experience fighting heavily armored cavalry , they are quickly dispatched by [STANNIS BARATHEON]' riders , who attack the wildling camp from both sides in [TWO] separate columns that catch the wildlings in a perfect double envelopment . quickly cutting the wildling forces down , [STANNIS BARATHEON] and [DAVOS] ride up to mance , who throws down his weapons in surrender , officially ending the wildlings' siege of [CASTLE BLACK] . 
 [DAVOS] introduces [STANNIS BARATHEON] as the true king of the [SEVEN KINGDOMS] , but mance wryly points out that they are not currently in the [SEVEN KINGDOMS] . [STANNIS BARATHEON] demands that it is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king . resignedly , mance says that the [FREE FOLK] do not kneel , knowing that [STANNIS BARATHEON] will [KILL] him if he does not . [DAVOS] , however , asks what a [MAN] of the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] is doing in the camp , and [JON SNOW] explains that he came to treaty with the king [BEYOND] the [WALL] . [JON SNOW] says that he knows that [STANNIS BARATHEON] is the true king , as his own father died supporting his claim , revealing himself as the bastard son of [EDDARD STARK] . this makes [STANNIS BARATHEON] regard [JON SNOW] more seriously . [STANNIS BARATHEON] proclaims that [EDDARD STARK] was an honorable [MAN] , and asks [JON SNOW] what ned would have done with mance . [JON SNOW] responds that mance could have killed him or tortured him when he was his captive but instead he spared his life , so instead of killing mance he should be taken prisoner and interrogated . before they leave the wildling camp , [JON SNOW] also urges [STANNIS BARATHEON] to burn the [DEAD] before nightfall . . 
melisandre looks through the flames , and sees [JON SNOW] . 
back at [CASTLE BLACK] , a funeral is held for the slain members of the [KNIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] , who have been arranged in a huge funeral pyre in the [CASTLE BLACK] courtyard . maester [AEMON] delivers a eulogy , saying that they died to protect the [MEN] , women , and [CHILDREN] of the south who will [NEVER] even know who they were , that it is the duty of the surviving [CASTLE BLACK] brothers to [KEEP] alive their memory . [AEMON] closes his speech with the customary line , and now their [WATCH] has [ENDED] , which is repeated by the gathered [MEN] . samwell then aids [AEMON] in setting the pyre alight , which is continued by [JON SNOW] and other [MEN] carrying torches . [STANNIS BARATHEON] and [DAVOS] look on , along with queen [SELYSE] and princess [SHIREEN] . [JON SNOW] looks across the flames and catches the gaze of melisandre , who is standing on the opposite side of the pyre . melisandre seems intrigued , her piercing stare clearly making [JON SNOW] uneasy . 
afterwards , [JON SNOW] enters the chamber of the [CASTLE BLACK] where tormund is being held . tormund asks why blind [OLD] maester [AEMON] patched up his arrow wounds , and [JON SNOW] says that [AEMON] is sworn to heal all wounded [MEN] , friend or foe . tormund asks if [JON SNOW] really loved ygritte . [JON SNOW] doesn't respond . tormund says that ygritte truly loved him , and that he knew because although she [NEVER] admitted it , she talked only of killing him , revealing her true feelings for him if she hadn't loved him , she wouldn't have been so angered by his betrayal . saddened , tormund implores [JON SNOW] that ygritte's final resting place should be in the real [NORTH] . [JON SNOW] then takes ygritte's corpse to the [NORTH] side of the [WALL] and builds a funeral pyre for her near a sacred heart tree . [JON SNOW] looks at his lover one last time and lights her pyre , and weeps silently as he turns his back and heads [HOME] . 
far to the [NORTH] , [BRAN] [EDDARD STARK] and the [REED] [CHILDREN] continue their journey to find the three eyed raven , though they are on the brink of exhaustion . jojen [REED] has grown sick and and he is barely able to stand , eventually collapsing into the [JON SNOW] . as meera begs jojen to gather what little strength he can muster to continue forward , [BRAN] calls out to them , revealing that they have found the massive heart tree that [BRAN] has seen in his visions . as they approach the tree , wights burst up from the [JON SNOW] , grabbing jojen's ankles and attempting to drag him under the ice . these wights appear far older than those seen near the [WALL] , appearing as ghastly skeletal warriors who move with surprising agility . meera attempts to defend jojen from the wights , but they begin to swarm over hodor , who is too scared to fight back . [BRAN] wargs into hodor's mind and begins fighting off the wights with the aid of his direwolf summer , but more wights [KEEP] bursting through the ice and they are quickly overwhelmed . 
just as all seems lost , the wights around [BRAN] suddenly burst into fireballs , and he hears a young girl's voice calling to him from a cave entrance at the base of the heart tree . amidst the confusion jojen is repeatedly stabbed by a wight before meera can fight it off . the mysterious girl calls to meera and says that jojen is lost and that she must leave him if she wants to live . meera hesitates , but jojen urges her to save herself . crying , meera slits her brother's throat to grant him the [MERCY] of a quick death . meera runs to the cave entrance along with [BRAN] , hodor , and summer while the mysterious child covers their retreat by magically throwing fireballs from her hands at the wights . just as the life drains from jojen's eyes , she launches a fireball at his body , immolating his corpse and preventing his return as a wight and fulfilling jojen's vision that his death would involve [FIRE] . 
they run into the cave , pursued by the wights , who instantly shatter upon crossing the threshold of the cave . the little girl explains that the power which animates the [DEAD] corpses is powerless inside the cave . when [BRAN] asks who she is , she replies that the [FIRST] [MEN] called us'the [CHILDREN] , but we were born long before them . [BRAN] realizes that she is one of the last surviving members of the [CHILDREN] of the forest , the original , non human inhabitants of westeros who carved the [FACES] into [WEIRWOOD] trees and taught the [FIRST] [MEN] to worship the [OLD GODS] thousands of years ago . 
the child leads them deeper into the cave , which is overgrown with [WHITE] [WEIRWOOD] roots from the massive tree above . other [CHILDREN] of the forest peek out around corners as they advance . finally , they arrive at a large central chamber , its floor littered with [BONES] . in the middle of the cave is an [OLD GODS] [MAN] seated in the middle of [WEIRWOOD] roots , which have grown around and even through much of his body . hodor places [BRAN] on the ground and [BRAN] crawls towards the [OLD GODS] [MAN] , asking if he is the three eyed raven who appeared in his visions . the [OLD GODS] [MAN] admits that he is , having taken several forms in the past , but his true form is before them now . meera is upset that her brother died to reach him , but the three eyed raven says that jojen who possessed the greensight , as [BRAN] does always knew that he would [DIE] helping [BRAN] arrive here , but that he came nonetheless . he informs them that he has been watching all of them throughout their entire lives with a thousand eyes , and one . he continues by stating that jojen died so that [BRAN] could [COME] here and regain what he has lost . [BRAN] asks if he means he will regain the use of his legs . the three eyed raven replies that [BRAN] will [NEVER] [WALK] again , but you will fly . .

in [MEEREEN] , queen [DAENERYS] [TARGARYEN] sits in her [THRONE] room where she is receiving the day's supplicants . an [OLD GODS] [MAN] named fennesz approaches the [THRONE] , [FIRST] speaking in [HIGH] valyrian but then revealing that he also knows the common tongue . fennesz explains that he was not one of the slaves who toiled away at manual labor , but a well educated teacher and servant to master [MIGHDAL] , who employed him as a teacher for his own [CHILDREN] . he tells daenarys that master [MIGHDAL] ['S] [SEVEN] year [OLD GODS] daughter calla admires [DAENERYS] , having learned of the [TARGARYEN] dynasty through fennesz's teachings . 
as a servant of master [MIGHDAL] , fennesz was well treated and even well respected in the household , but when [DAENERYS] forcibly freed all of the slaves in the city she did not understand the full scale complications of suddenly having to care for so many people . fennesz originally stayed in master [MIGHDAL] ['S] [HOUSE] after she took the city , and [MIGHDAL] ['S] [CHILDREN] begged him to stay , but [MIGHDAL] and fennesz agreed that he must leave rather than face reprisals , forcing fennesz to become homeless . [DAENERYS] insists that she had established mess halls to feed the freed slaves and barracks to [HOUSE] them . fennez says that he has visited these refugee centers and they are not very safe the young prey on the [OLD GODS] , assaulting and robbing them . [DAENERYS] insists that her [UNSULLIED] will restore order , but fennesz points out that even assuming that they are able to ensure his physical safety , he has lost his livelihood and his purpose and is too [OLD GODS] to start anew . therefore , he has [COME] to [DAENERYS] to beg her permission to sell himself back to [MIGHDAL] . she is shocked that he would want to be owned as a slave again , as a [MAN] might own a goat or a chair . he implores her that the young [MAY] rejoice in her [NEW] world , but for those too [OLD GODS] to change , there is only fear and squalor . nor , he says , is he alone there are many supplicants waiting outside lining up to make similar requests . 
 [DAENERYS] is crestfallen , and says she did not liberate the slaves of [MEEREEN] only to preside over the very injustice she sought to destroy , but surprisingly relents and admits that freedom means making one's own choices . therefore she will allow fennesz to enter into a labor contract with [MIGHDAL] , but lasting no more than one year . he earnestly thanks her , and leaves . ser [BARRISTAN SELMY] warns [DAENERYS] that the masters will assuredly take advantage of this , quickly making contracts with all of the displaced former slaves until they are all slaves again in all but [NAME] . 
the next supplicant then enters , a shepherd carrying a bundle in his arms , similarly to the herdsman who came to show the [BONES] of their livestock which [DAENERYS] ['S] [DRAGONS] burned in order to be reimbursed . the shepherd timidly approaches and states that he is unable to speak in the common tongue and requires missandei to translate . distraught , he tells daenarys that the winged shadow came , placing the bundle on the ground and opening it to reveal charred [BONES] of a human child . [DAENERYS] ['S] largest dragon the [BLACK] one , drogon has roasted the [MAN] ['S] three year [OLD GODS] daughter zalla until this is all that was left of her . horrified , [DAENERYS] meets with missandei and grey worm in private to discuss how to deal with the growing threat the [DRAGONS] are posing to the people of [MEEREEN] . grey worm reports that drogon was last seen flying over the [BLACK] cliffs three days ago , but he can no longer be found . realizing that she can no longer control her [DRAGONS] , [DAENERYS] tells them to head with her to the catacombs under the city . later , she leads her remaining [TWO] [DRAGONS] , rhaegal and viserion , into the catacombs , where they are distracted by sheep carcasses . as they are feeding , [DAENERYS] personally locks huge [IRON] collars around their necks , which are secured by heavy [CHAINS] . she weeps as she does so , as it is symbolically reducing her remaining [CHILDREN] to chained up slaves themselves . [DAENERYS] wordlessly leaves and closes the huge stone [DOOR] to the catacombs behind her as her [DRAGONS] grow distressed and pathetically call after her when they attempt to follow and realize they are chained in place .

in grand maester [PYCELLE] ['S] laboratory in king's landing , [CERSEI] , [PYCELLE] , and qyburn stand over ser [GREGOR CLEGANE] , who lies immobilized on a flat wooden table and is revealed to be suffering from a massive wound centered around his right side . [PYCELLE] informs [CERSEI] that [OBERYN] [MARTELL] had coated his spear with manticore venom , poisoning ser [GREGOR CLEGANE] . the effects are horrific , with [GREGOR CLEGANE] ['S] wounds putrefying and creating a terrible stench . [PYCELLE] says that he is [BEYOND] any hope of recovery , but qyburn insists to [CERSEI] that he can save him using more unorthodox methods . [PYCELLE] chaffes at his suggestion , stating that he is not even a maester , and that such arrogance is what led to qyburn's expulsion from the citadel in the [FIRST] place , for experiments that were deemed both dangerous and unnatural . [CERSEI] , determined to save [GREGOR CLEGANE] from death , dismisses [PYCELLE] and orders qyburn to do whatever is necessary , infuriating [PYCELLE] , who angrily shuffles out of the laboratory . she asks qyburn if his treatment will work , and qyburn claims that if his past work is any indicator , he stands a chance at saving [GREGOR CLEGANE] . qyburn states that the process will change him , although [CERSEI] seems only concerned with whether it will weaken him , to which qyburn replies oh no . [CERSEI] leaves , and qyburn begins syphoning out [GREGOR CLEGANE] ['S] tainted [BLOOD] . 
 [CERSEI] approaches [TYWIN] and insists that she will not submit to a forced marriage to ser [LORAS] [TYRELL] . he attempts to dismiss the subject by stating that the matter is closed , but she persists and says that it is not just because she does not love [LORAS] he wants to ship her off to highgarden and remove her from the court entirely , keeping her away from her last remaining son . with [CERSEI] out of the picture , both [MARGAERY] and [TYWIN] will attempt to get their claws into [TOMMEN] , each trying to manipulate him into their allegiance . [TYWIN] refuses to budge , so [CERSEI] plays her trump card she threatens to destroy [HOUSE LANNISTER] by telling everyone the truth . [TYWIN] seems confused , and at [FIRST] [CERSEI] scoffs that he is merely feigning ignorance . with growing realization , she assesses that even the brilliant [TYWIN LANNISTER] [NEVER] noticed what was going on between his own [CHILDREN] , when all it would have taken was one attentive moment in the past twenty years . [TYWIN LANNISTER] is still apparently confused , so with a merciless grin [CERSEI] reveals that all of the rumors about her and [JAIME] and their [CHILDREN] are true she will tell everyone and destroy [TYWIN LANNISTER] ['S] vaunted family legacy , even though it will also mean her death and [TOMMEN] ['S] death . [TYWIN LANNISTER] shakes with barely constrained rage , but in denial he accuses that [CERSEI] is simply lying to anger him . [CERSEI] says she doubts he truly thinks that and leaves him standing in his chamber alone . 
 [CERSEI] finds [JAIME] in the [WHITE] sword [TOWER] , and he expresses disgust at her blatant attempts to have [TYRION] killed . [CERSEI] asserts that [TYRION] killed their [MOTHER] when she gave birth to him . [JAIME] is surprised that she still irrationally blames him for that , pointing out that he was an infant and had no control over what happened . he insists that [TYRION] is her family , whether she chooses to accept it or not . she rebukes his claim , saying he is not her family and that they all have a choice , and that she chooses [JAIME] . she then reveals that she has spilled their secret to [TYWIN LANNISTER] . he is stunned and concerned by her actions , asking how [TYWIN LANNISTER] reacted to the news , but she states that she does not want to discuss their father . she begins to seduce him , saying she chooses her brother over everyone else in the world , no longer concerned with whether anyone else knows their secret . he yields to her advances , kissing her passionately and throwing her on the table where they begin to have sex . 
in the middle of the [NIGHT] , [TYRION] is awoken in his cell by the sound of his cell [DOOR] being opened by [JAIME] , who reveals that he has orchestrated an escape plan for [TYRION] with the assistance of [VARYS] , who has secured a galley in the harbor on which [TYRION] can sneak out of the city and flee to the [FREE] cities . he leads [TYRION] to a stairway leading up to a locked [DOOR] , instructing [TYRION] to knock on it twice and then twice more to summon [VARYS] , who will lead him to the ship . before they part ways , [TYRION] and [JAIME] share a tender embrace and say their goodbyes , unsure if either will ever see the other again . 
 [TYRION] , alone , stares at the [DOOR] at the top of the staircase , ultimately deciding to use the secret passages of the [RED KEEP] to infiltrate the [TOWER] of the [HAND] . he enters the [HAND] of the king's quarters , and sees a [WOMAN] lying in [TYWIN LANNISTER] ['S] bed , with [TYWIN LANNISTER] ['S] clothes folded up on a chair . as he draws closer he sees that the [WOMAN] is shae , who thinks it is [TYWIN LANNISTER] and calls out for him , calling him my [LION] as she had once done to [TYRION] . when she turns over and sees that it is [TYRION] , looking utterly betrayed , she grabs a knife to defend herself . [TYRION] could retreat but instead he rushes forward onto the bed to wrestle it from her grasp . [TYRION] manages to knock the knife from her hands and the [TWO] continue to struggle violently until [TYRION] manages to grab the necklace around her throat which he once gave her as a [GIFT] and strangles her with it . he continues to strangle her long after she has stopped resisting , until she is [DEAD] . he sinks to the floor and sits next to shae's lifeless body , weeping , and tells her he's sorry . he stares at the [WALL] across the room and sees several weapons on display , among them [JOFFREY] ['S] [OLD] crossbow , and his expression quickly darkens . 
 [TYRION] takes the crossbow down from the [WALL] , loads it , and heads down the [HALL] to the privy , opening the [DOOR] to find his father seated upon the toilet . [TYWIN LANNISTER] seems surprised to see [TYRION] , but quickly regains composure and asks [TYRION] to lower the crossbow . he correctly deduces that [JAIME] helped [TYRION] escape his cell , telling [TYRION] that they can discuss the matter back in [TYWIN LANNISTER] ['S] chambers . however , when he attempts to stand , [TYRION] steadies the crossbow , stopping him [DEAD] in his tracks . all my life you've wanted me [DEAD] , [TYRION] states , and [TYWIN LANNISTER] acknowledges the validity of his claim . he attempts to defuse the situation by telling [TYRION] that despite this , [TYRION] has stubbornly clung to life , which [TYWIN LANNISTER] states he finds admirable and insists that he was [NEVER] going to have [TYRION] actually killed . [TYRION] admits that he just murdered shae with his bare hands , but [TYWIN LANNISTER] scoffs that it doesn't matter as she was nothing more than a whore . [TYRION] is angered by [TYWIN LANNISTER] ['S] indifference and raises the crossbow , threatening that if his father says the word whore one more time he will [KILL] him . [TYWIN LANNISTER] balks that [TYRION] won't [KILL] his own father in the privy , and again tries to convince [TYRION] that they should continue to discuss this in his chambers . [TYRION] says he can not go back to [TYWIN LANNISTER] ['S] chambers because shae's body is still there . [TYWIN LANNISTER] dares [TYRION] by calling his bluff and mocking him by saying because you're afraid of a [DEAD] whore . 
 [TYRION] was not bluffing . the moment [TYWIN LANNISTER] utters the word whore again , [TYRION] looses his crossbow bolt , hitting [TYWIN LANNISTER] in the belly and knocking him backwards . [TYWIN LANNISTER] is incredulous that [TYRION] actually had the courage to fight back against him , and that he will [DIE] in such an undignified way at the hands of his hated dwarf son . as [TYRION] reloads the crossbow , [TYWIN LANNISTER] angrily declares that [TYRION] is no son of his . i am your son , [TYRION] replies quietly , i have always been your son , and fires a [SECOND] bolt into [TYWIN LANNISTER] ['S] heart , killing him . [TYRION] discards the crossbow as he leaves to find [VARYS] , who immediately realizes [TYRION] has done something terrible , exclaiming what have you done nonetheless , he leads [TYRION] out of the [CASTLE] to the docks where [TYRION] is stowed away inconspicuously in a crate aboard the ship . [VARYS] begins walking back towards the [RED KEEP] but stops when he hears the bells begin to toll , signaling the discovery of [TYWIN LANNISTER] ['S] body . realizing that returning to the [CASTLE] is likely unsafe , [VARYS] turns around and heads back for the ship , sitting next to [TYRION] ['S] crate in silence as they cast off for essos . 
in the [VALE] , brienne of [TARTH] and podrick [PAYNE] are heading towards the bloody gate when they happen upon arya [STARK] practicing her [WATER] dancing while sandor [CLEGANE] is off relieving himself , both returning from the [EYRIE] after receiving [WORDS] of [LYSA ARRYN] ['S] death . brienne and arya converse for a moment , both showing respect for one another as they are both women who have fought against what has been expected of them their entire lives . they are interrupted by the return of the hound , who is immediately recognized by podrick , causing brienne to realize that the girl is arya . brienne tells arya of her sacred vow to protect her [MOTHER] , although she failed to do so because she was sent by her [MOTHER] to return [JAIME] [TYWIN LANNISTER] . the hound immediately accuses brienne of working for the [LANNISTERS] , noticing her valyrian steel sword [OATHKEEPER] , which brienne admits was given to her by [JAIME] , frightening arya into thinking that brienne is working for the [LANNISTERS] . brienne implores arya to [COME] with her to safety , causing the hound to mock brienne , pointing out that there is no safety for arya anymore her aunt [LYSA ARRYN] in the [EYRIE] whom brienne and podrick are seeking out is [DEAD] , as are her father , [MOTHER] , and older brother , while the [STARK] armies are scattered and [WINTERFELL] is a smoking ruin . they draw [SWORDS] and begin fighting , both eventually disarming each other and resorting to brutally fighting each other in [HAND] to [HAND] combat . ultimately , brienne gains the upper [HAND] by biting off a chunk of sandor's ear and knocks him down a cliff side . brienne goes to search for arya , who slipped away during the melee and has hidden herself amongst the rock formations . as brienne and podrick search the surrounding area for arya in vain , arya makes her way down the cliff side to find the hound badly wounded . he tells her that unless there is a maester miraculously on [HAND] to tend to his wounds , he's finished . sandor tells her to [KILL] him and scratch another [NAME] off her list , but she just sits and stares at him silently . he grows angry and begins recounting running down the butcher's [BOY] and how he should have raped sansa in king's landing in an attempt to goad arya into killing him in anger , but she remains silent . sandor finally begs her to [KILL] him and put him out of his misery , but she quietly refuses and takes his money purse , leaving him screaming at her to [KILL] him as she silently walks away . 
arya rides a horse to the nearby coast of the [VALE] , where she sees a wharf with ships docked . she approaches a captain and asks if she can pay for travel to the [NORTH] , but he says that they won't go there because these days the [NORTH] is full of war , cold , and pirates . instead , the ship is going [HOME] to the [FREE] city of braavos . arya [REMEMBERS] the special coin that the faceless [MAN] known as jaqen h'ghar gave her , and instructed her to present to any [MAN] from braavos if she needed aid . she does so now , and the captain is utterly surprised at how she obtained it , but she says only [VALAR MORGHULIS] as jaqen instructed , to which the captain gives the traditional response , [VALAR DOHAERIS] . he warmly welcomes her aboard the ship , and insists that she will have her own cabin . as the ship casts off , arya stands aboard the ship and watches as the shore of westeros shrinks further and further away . she then moves to the prow of the ship , looking forward across the narrow sea in the direction of the [FREE] cities and braavos .

[TYRION] has descended into bitterness and self loathing , seemingly determined to drink himself to death , but [VARYS] angrily snaps him out of his self pity , telling [TYRION] that he still has talents that [MAY] yet be of use talents that he could use to seat the right candidate on the [IRON THRONE] . [VARYS] states that westeros is mired in chaos and on the brink of ruin the [SEVEN KINGDOMS] requires a ruler , one stronger than [TOMMEN] yet gentler than [STANNIS] , beloved by the people , able to please the common [FOLK] and [KEEP] the nobility in line . when [TYRION] retorts that such a [MAN] does not exist , [VARYS] points out that he [NEVER] said this ruler would be a [MAN] . [VARYS] offers [TYRION] the choice of either drinking himself to death in pentos , or travelling with him to [MEEREEN] to support [DAENERYS] [HOUSE TARGARYEN] . after a moment , [TYRION] agrees .

at a small council meeting , master of coin [MACE] [TYRELL] brings bad news that the [IRON] bank of braavos is starting to call in its debts from westeros . they have started by calling in a tenth of the [IRON THRONE] ['S] current debts to the bank , which it can only afford half of as rebuilding the royal fleet was also a massive expense . [MACE] offers that [HOUSE TYRELL] could front the money for the time being , but [CERSEI] clearly does not want to give the tyrells more power over the [CROWN] . instead , she says that they will send [MACE] himself to braavos to negotiate for more time , because sending such a [HIGH SPARROW] ranking official will show the bank how seriously they take their large debts . [MACE] is oblivious that this is also [CERSEI] ['S] way of removing him from the capital , and takes it as a [HIGH SPARROW] [HONOR] as well as that [CERSEI] will send ser [MERYN TRANT] of the [KINGSGUARD] along to guard him . after he leaves , [PYCELLE] bitterly points out that the small council is growing even smaller the only three members left in the capital are [PYCELLE] , [CERSEI] , and her lackey qyburn , but she says it hasn't quite grown small enough yet . 
 [CERSEI] meets with the [HIGH SPARROW] . 
 [CERSEI] then meets with the [HIGH SPARROW] , who by her influence , has been elected as the [NEW] [HIGH SPARROW] septon of the faith of the [SEVEN] . [CERSEI] is trying to build up a [NEW] alliance between the [CROWN] and the faith , as a counterweight against the large political influence the tyrells now possess . [CERSEI] points out to the [HIGH SPARROW] that the war of the five kings has devastated much of the countryside , resulting in septs being burned , clergymen attacked , and even silent sisters raped . bodies of holy [MEN] are piling up in the streets . the [HIGH SPARROW] admits that [WARS] make [MEN] obey the sword more than the [GODS] . [CERSEI] points out that before the targaryens , the military order known as the faith militant dispensed the justice of the [SEVEN] . the [HIGH SPARROW] septon is confused , as the targaryens disbanded the faith militant over [TWO] centuries ago . [CERSEI] explains that , as part of the [NEW] alliance she hopes to build between the [CROWN] and the faith , she will tell her son to repeal the law and allow the faith militant to be reestablished and re armed an army whose purpose is to defend the faith , holy [MEN] , and the smallfolk and which will incidentally be turned against the [CROWN] ['S] enemies . she then advises him that there is a [GREAT] sinner in their midst who has been shielded by gold and power . the [HIGH SPARROW] replies with a wish for the father to judge him justly . 
the [NEW] faith militant storm the streets of king's landing , attacking taverns , brothels , and street vendors selling idols from other religions . the city [WATCH] look on , helpless , and do not intervene . they ransack littlefinger's brothel , dragging prostitutes like marei out into the street by their hair . olyvar is struck and ignored as they barge in he then sees that in another room they have singled out a [WOMAN] having sex with one of the male prostitutes , and approach him with a knife . olyvar flees . 
 [TOMMEN] attempts to have his brother in law [LORAS] released , but fails . 
as a sign of their zealotry , the faith militant have the [SEVEN] pointed star symbol of the faith carved into their foreheads including lancel , who leads a squad of the faith militant to apprehend [LORAS] [HOUSE TYRELL] while he is sparring in the practice yard . lancel proclaims that [LORAS]' sexual perversions are sins against the [LAWS] of [GODS] and [TOMMEN] , and [LORAS] is dragged off . [MARGAERY] [HOUSE TYRELL] is furious at [TOMMEN] for her brother's arrest , then tries to manipulate him by weeping at how hurt she is that he let this happen to [LORAS] . [TOMMEN] then goes to his [MOTHER] and , briefly standing up to her , demands that [LORAS] be released at once . [CERSEI] calmly points out that she didn't arrest [LORAS] , the faith militant simply dragged him off and imprisoned him , so he should ask the [HIGH SPARROW] to release him . [TOMMEN] naively thinks the [HIGH SPARROW] will simply do as he requests , so he heads to the [GREAT SEPT] of [BAELOR] with five [KINGSGUARD] and several [LANNISTER] guards . the path to the [GREAT SEPT] is blocked by the faith militant , who say that the [HIGH SPARROW] is praying and does not wish to be disturbed . the [KINGSGUARD] request that [TOMMEN] let them [KILL] the faith militant to pass . [TOMMEN] is surprised at this and does not want to risk bloodshed escalating matters particularly , shedding [BLOOD] on holy ground . unsure of what to do , the mob of commoners behind him starts shouting that he is really a bastard and an abomination of incest . realizing this is not going to [END] well , [TOMMEN] meekly withdraws back to the [RED KEEP] . [MARGAERY] is even more upset at how ineffectual young [TOMMEN] was , so she leaves saying that she is going to bring her grandmother [OLENNA] back to the capital to deal with this .

 [JAIME] [LANNISTER] and ser [BRONN] are on a pentoshi merchant ship , which is headed to oldtown in the reach . they sail past [TARTH] , off the coast of the [STORMLANDS] , which [JAIME] mistakenly identifies as estermont . the captain corrects him , stating that they are sailing through the sapphire isle , which reminds him of brienne . [JAIME] explains to [BRONN] that he bribed the captain to let them take a small boat to shore as they pass dorne , and they will land just outside of sunspear and the adjacent [WATER GARDENS] . below decks , [BRONN] remarks on why [JAIME] must want to go and protect princess [MYRCELLA] for himself he's the one who let [TYRION] escape , and he hopes this will make up for that . [JAIME] curtly says that [VARYS] did when in fact , [JAIME] forced [VARYS] to help him [FREE] [TYRION] . [BRONN] says that if [JAIME] ever sees [TYRION] again [JAIME] should give him his regards [JAIME] angrily says that if he sees his brother again , he's going to split him in [TWO] for murdering their father [TYWIN] . 
 [JAIME] uses his metal [HAND] to stop a blade . 
 [BRONN] rows the pair ashore at dusk , though [JAIME] can't help row with his one [HAND] . when they awake the next morning [BRONN] kills a snake that was near [JAIME] ['S] head and roasts it up for breakfast . [BRONN] is worried that the ship's captain will subsequently spread word that a [LANNISTER] is in dorne [JAIME] says he bribed him with a large bag of gold , but [BRONN] still worries . a mounted patrol soon comes by , however , and sees their tracks in the sand . [JAIME] and [BRONN] present themselves and try to pass off that they are simple travelers and their boat capsized in the [NIGHT] , but the ruse doesn't work , and the sentries demand that they drop their weapons so they can be taken prisoner and their identities confirmed . [BRONN] plants his sword in the sand then quickly throws his dagger in the lead sentry's throat . [JAIME] and [BRONN] draw their [SWORDS] and fight the rest . [JAIME] can't fight very well left handed so [BRONN] kills one sentry's horse in order for [JAIME] to fight him on foot . [JAIME] is being overpowered but catches the sentry's sword with his metal [HAND] at the last moment . he then uses the distraction to land a killing blow to the sentry with his left [HAND] . [BRONN] , having finished off the other sentries , notes that they now have their horses fine dornish sand steeds , capable of running a day and a [NIGHT] [WITHOUT] tiring . [JAIME] says the bodies need to be buried so they won't raise more questions . [BRONN] says it will take a lot of time to dig holes for them all , though [JAIME] again points out that he can't really do much digging with one [HAND] . annoyed , [BRONN] then drags off the bodies to bury . 
the sand snakes torture a merchant ship captain . 
meanwhile , elsewhere outside of sunspear , ellaria sand meets with three of the eight sand snakes , her lover [OBERYN] [MARTELL] ['S] bastard daughters . obara sand , the eldest , is the daughter of a peasant nymeria sand commonly called nym is the daughter of an eastern noblewoman the youngest of the three , tyene sand , is ellaria's own daughter . she informs them that [PRINCE] [DORAN] [MARTELL] will not raise dorne's armies to avenge his brother's death . they worry that they have no army to march against the [LANNISTERS] , but ellaria tells them that they don't need one to start a war , all they need to do is [KILL] [CERSEI] ['S] daughter [MYRCELLA] , currently in [DORAN] ['S] possession . 
obara then points out that they [MAY] have a problem . the pentoshi ship captain found her in planky town , and as [BRONN] feared , he indeed tried to sell her information about [JAIME] [LANNISTER] ['S] arrival in dorne . the sand snakes , however , were insulted that he wanted to be paid for such vital information instead of offering it freely , so they took him prisoner and tortured it out of him . nymeria uses her whip to knock a bucket over , and reveals underneath that they buried the ship's captain [NECK] deep in the sand , with his head under a bucket full of poisonous scorpions . they realize that they are now in a race against time to see who can take [MYRCELLA] from [DORAN] [FIRST] [JAIME] [LANNISTER] or themselves . ellaria asks if the three girls are with her , knowing this will bring dorne into war . nymeria and tyene say yes . obara notes that when she [FIRST] met [OBERYN] , he was a [MAN] whom she had [NEVER] met who one day appeared , said he was her father , and that he was taking her away from her [MOTHER] . her [MOTHER] wept , but [OBERYN] said that , we all must choose our battles and the [GODS] let us choose our weapons . he threw his spear at her feet , pointed to her [MOTHER] ['S] tears , then to his spear , and told her to choose . she chose the spear and answers ellaria that she is with her , as she chose the path of the spear and war long ago . she then throws her spear to impale the ship captain's head .

[JORAH MORMONT] will not volunteer any information about himself , but from a few observations such as the [BEAR] sigil on his armor , [TYRION] quickly surmises that he must be [JORAH MORMONT] . he admits to [TYRION] that the queen he is taking him to is not [CERSEI] but [DAENERYS] . [TYRION] recalls from small council meetings that [JORAH MORMONT] was spying on [DAENERYS] for [VARYS] . given that he is half the world away from [DAENERYS] , he also accurately deduces that she must have found out he was spying on her and had him exiled and therefore , he kidnapped [TYRION] in the hope that presenting him as a [GIFT] to [DAENERYS] will get him back in her favor . [TYRION] laughs aloud at his situation , informing [JORAH MORMONT] that he was already heading to meet [DAENERYS] , so this is a [WASTE] of a kidnapping . [TYRION] also points out that there is no guarantee this will assuage [DAENERYS] , and it is just as likely she will remain angry at [JORAH MORMONT] , and welcome himself as an ally . [JORAH MORMONT] smacks [TYRION] across the face , quieting him down .

melisandre seduces [JON] . 
 [JON SNOW] trains recruits in the practice yard of [CASTLE BLACK] , as [STANNIS BARATHEON] and his wife [SELYSE] [WATCH] , along with their daughter [SHIREEN] . [SELYSE] is worried that [STANNIS BARATHEON] wishes [JON SNOW] was his son , because she gave him only stillbirths and weakness , but he says that wasn't her fault . melisandre joins them and appears to quite firmly take [STANNIS BARATHEON] ['S] side , declaring that the [LORD] of light doesn't care about [SHIREEN] ['S] greyscale disfigurement , and this doesn't change the fact that she has her father's [BLOOD] . when [SELYSE] departs , melisandre discusses the [COMING] [BATTLE] to take [WINTERFELL] from the [BOLTONS] . she asks if [STANNIS BARATHEON] intends to leave her behind as he did at the [BLACKWATER] , but [STANNIS BARATHEON] assures her he won't this time . 
as the [NEW] [LORD] commander , [JON SNOW] goes over paperwork with samwell tarly , letters they have received from minor [HOUSES] offering up a handful of [NEW] recruits . [JON SNOW] balks when samwell hands him a request letter for [ROOSE BOLTON] , saying he killed his brother [ROBB] . [SAM] points out that [ROOSE BOLTON] is now the warden of the [NORTH] , and he has the most recruits to send them much more than the pittances offered by the other minor [HOUSES] [JON SNOW] has [NEVER] even heard of . he reminds [JON SNOW] that the [NIGHT] ['S] [WATCH] has sworn an oath of political neutrality . with disgust , [JON SNOW] reluctantly signs the letter to the [BOLTONS] . 
as [SAM] departs , melisandre enters . she entreats him to assist [STANNIS BARATHEON] in retaking [WINTERFELL] , pointing out that even if he doesn't become a [STARK] , his familiarity with the [CASTLE BLACK] could [WIN] them the [BATTLE] . she also acknowledges that there is a greater war at stake , and asks [JON SNOW] if he is on the side of life or death , undoing her dress and straddling him as she does so . she encourages [JON SNOW] to take her , as the [LORD] of light made humans male and female for a reason although clearly tempted , [JON SNOW] refuses , citing his vows , and the fact that [STANNIS BARATHEON] wouldn't approve to which melisandre suggests they not tell him . when melisandre points out that he broke his vows once before , [JON SNOW] acknowledges that he still feels for his deceased love . melisandre adjusts her dress and leaves , but not before uttering the [WORDS] the [NEW] [LORD] commander thought he'd [NEVER] hear again you know nothing , [JON SNOW] . 
later , [STANNIS BARATHEON] is in his chambers at [CASTLE BLACK] working on other letters , and [SHIREEN] enters . [STANNIS BARATHEON] begins to apologise for dragging her along on campaign with him , as [CASTLE BLACK] is hardly a place for a child , but [SHIREEN] cuts him off she is happy to have [COME] , having expected to be left at dragonstone , as [SELYSE] had made it clear she wanted . [SHIREEN] asks her father if he is ashamed of her because of her deformity [STANNIS BARATHEON] gets up from his table and explains that not long after [SHIREEN] was born , a dornish trader arrived on dragonstone and , having heard of [SHIREEN] ['S] birth , gave a wooden doll as a [GIFT] for the newborn girl . unfortunately , the doll was contaminated with greyscale , and by the time that was discovered , [SHIREEN] had already contracted the disease . everyone claimed [SHIREEN] would [DIE] of it sooner or later , and urged [STANNIS BARATHEON] to send her to the ruins of [VALYRIA] to live out her days with the stone [MEN] before the disease infected the rest of the [CASTLE BLACK] [STANNIS BARATHEON] says he told them all to go to hell and summoned every healer , apothecary and maester he could to save [SHIREEN] . [STANNIS BARATHEON] insists that [SHIREEN] is his daughter and he would not send her away because she belonged with her family .

sansa visits the tombs of her family . 
at [WINTERFELL] , sansa [STARK] takes the opportunity to visit her family's underground crypts . she comes to the tomb and statue of her aunt [LYANNA] [STARK] and finds the feather token that [ROBERT BARATHEON] left there years ago when he visited the [CASTLE BLACK] . petyr [BAELISH] arrives and says he thought he'd find her there . sansa remarks that her father , [EDDARD STARK] , [NEVER] talked about [LYANNA] , but she would at times find him down in the crypts lighting candles at her tomb . sansa [NEVER] knew [LYANNA] because she died before she was born , but she notes that people say she was beautiful . 
littlefinger says that he actually saw [LYANNA] once years ago , and she was as beautiful as everyone says . back when he was a [BOY] living with sansa's [MOTHER] ['S] family , the [OLD] [LORD] whent of [HARRENHAL] held a massive tournament every notable figure of the time came from across westeros the mad king , [CROWN] [PRINCE] [RHAEGAR TARGARYEN] , [ROBERT BARATHEON] , [LYANNA] [EDDARD STARK] , everyone . [LYANNA] had already been publicly betrothed to [ROBERT BARATHEON] at the time . [BAELISH] [REMEMBERS] how awed he was , a [BOY] from nowhere and with no significant holdings , to see all of these living legends gathered in one place . in the final tilt , [PRINCE] [RHAEGAR TARGARYEN] rode against ser [BARRISTAN SELMY] . [RHAEGAR TARGARYEN] won and the entire crowd erupted in cheers only to suddenly drop [DEAD] silent when [RHAEGAR TARGARYEN] rode right past his wife , elia [MARTELL] , to lay the victor's [CROWN] made of blue [WINTER] roses in [LYANNA] ['S] lap . not long afterwards , [RHAEGAR TARGARYEN] made off with [LYANNA] , sparking off [ROBERT BARATHEON] ['S] rebellion which overthrew the [RHAEGAR TARGARYEN] dynasty . littlefinger wonders how many thousands died because [RHAEGAR TARGARYEN] chose [LYANNA] to which sansa says that he chose her , then kidnapped and raped her . [BAELISH] gives her a wry look and moves on to another part of the crypts . 
sansa notices that littlefinger is wearing riding clothes , and he explains that he is heading back to king's landing , because [CERSEI] sent a letter requesting his presence and it would be best not to make her suspicious by refusing to [COME] . sansa will be alone with the [BOLTONS] but he explains his plan to her [STANNIS BARATHEON] will have to attack the [BOLTONS] soon if he is to beat the [WINTER] snows , and he bets that [STANNIS BARATHEON] will probably [WIN] , because he is one of the best military commanders in all of westeros , and the [BOLTONS] will be outnumbered by [STANNIS BARATHEON] , as the other northern [HOUSES] would be quick to betray their liege [LORD] . [STANNIS BARATHEON] will then make sansa the [NEW] ruler of the [NORTH] , as the last known surviving [EDDARD STARK] heir and in memory of her father [EDDARD STARK] ['S] support for [STANNIS BARATHEON] . sansa asks what will happen on the off chance that [STANNIS BARATHEON] gets killed , and littlefinger explains that marrying [RAMSAY] [BOLTON] now will at least leave sansa in a position to insinuate herself among the [BOLTONS] and help destroy them from within in future plans . either way , sansa will be littlefinger's powerful ally in the [NORTH] . littlefinger kisses sansa on the lips , and departs .

dany speaks with ser [BARRISTAN SELMY] . 
in [MEEREEN] , [DAENERYS] [RHAEGAR TARGARYEN] is looking down on the streets below from her royal apartments in the [GREAT] pyramid , and ser [BARRISTAN SELMY] also brings up [RHAEGAR TARGARYEN] . he says that the city's inhabitants always seem happy from such a distance , but [RHAEGAR TARGARYEN] actually liked to leave the [RED KEEP] and mingle with the common people on the streets . [BARRISTAN SELMY] accompanied him often to guard him , and says that [RHAEGAR TARGARYEN] liked to sing to people . he was a [GREAT] singer , so he would find a place on one of the streets just like any public minstrel and sing . he liked to see how much money he could make , and everyone enjoyed his singing , so he often made quite a lot . [DAENERYS] is surprised , because her brother viserys only told her that [RHAEGAR TARGARYEN] was a [GREAT] killer . . 
an injured grey worm continues to fight the [SONS] of the [HARPY] . 
 [BARRISTAN SELMY] scoffs that [RHAEGAR TARGARYEN] was a [GREAT] warrior but [NEVER] enjoyed killing , he was a gentle [MAN] who enjoyed singing . she asks what they did with all the money , and [BARRISTAN SELMY] says that they did all sorts of [THINGS] sometimes they just gave it to the next minstrel on the road , once [RHAEGAR TARGARYEN] gave it all to an orphanage in the slums of flea bottom , and one time they spent it to get horribly drunk . daario naharis then comes to say that the day's supplicants are waiting in the [THRONE] room , chief among them hizdahr zo loraq . aware of his dislike of politics , [DAENERYS] asks if [BARRISTAN SELMY] wants to attend her in the [THRONE] room after being assured that daario has her back , she gives him the day off , cheerfully telling him to make some music in the city below . 
hizdahr again beseeches [DAENERYS] to reopen the fighting pits of [MEEREEN] , because today is the traditional beginning of the fighting season . [DAENERYS] again refuses , but hizdahr rationally argues that the fighting pits provide a [GREAT] spectacle that has always been enjoyed by both the slave masters and slaves , and is one of the few [THINGS] that can bring the city together . bringing back this major tradition will not instantly solve all of her problems , he concedes , but it would be a start at mending together her subjects . 
 [BARRISTAN SELMY] runs towards danger . 
as he speaks , the [SONS] of the [HARPY] are already mounting a series of large scale attacks in the streets . a meereenese prostitute helps them distract and [KILL] some of the [SECOND SONS] , and when a patrol of [UNSULLIED] arrives , she feigns fear and directs them into a trap by pointing that the [SECOND SONS] of the [HARPY] ran into a narrow alleyway . the [UNSULLIED] give chase , only to be surrounded by a much larger number of the [SECOND SONS] of the [HARPY] . brutal fighting rages throughout the streets of [MEEREEN] . grey worm is among the ambushed [UNSULLIED] he kills many attackers , though he loses his helmet , is slashed in the leg , and is stabbed in his side . grey worm pulls the dagger out of himself , stabs a foe in the throat with it , and keeps fighting , though his wounds slow him considerably . most of the [SECOND SONS] of the [HARPY] are [DEAD] but they outnumber the [UNSULLIED] so much to begin with that only grey worm is left . just then , ser [BARRISTAN SELMY] arrives and saves grey worm by drawing the attention of the remaining rebels . he takes on eight [SECOND SONS] of the [HARPY] and defeats them all , save for the last one , who stabs him in the belly . he falls to his knees and just as his attacker is about to slit his throat , grey worm takes him out by shoving his spear into his back . grey worm staggers over [BARRISTAN SELMY] , but he has lost consciousness . severely wounded , grey worm then slumps down to the floor next to him .

 [DAENERYS] asks missandei whether she should reopen the fighting pits . missandei only says that she has seen [DAENERYS] listening to her counselors when her own experience was lacking and ignoring them when she thought they were wrong .

[DAENERYS] tells him she has decided to reopen the fighting pits , but only for [FREE] [MEN] . she also says that she will marry the head of an ancient family of [MEEREEN] to forge a bond with the people of the city , and that she luckily has one of them on his knees already . she leaves a very confused hizdahr to ponder that he will live , and that he will soon be [MEEREEN] ['S] [PRINCE] consort .

[TYRION] is annoyed that they didn't find any villages to steal a boat or supplies from as [JORAH MORMONT] had hoped , so they're slowly walking and only have berries and roots to eat . the topic of just why [TYRION] was even in volantis comes up , and [TYRION] is surprised that [JORAH MORMONT] did not ask earlier he explains that he actually fled from westeros because he killed his own father [TYWIN] . he says he did it because his father tried to have him executed for a crime he didn't commit , and then he found his father screwing the [WOMAN] he loved [JORAH MORMONT] nods , as this seems as likely a motivation for kinslaying as any .

[OLENNA] [FIRST] tries to bribe him , but learning that he can not be bought , threatens to [END] the [TYRELL] support for the capital by ending shipments of food . again the [HIGH SPARROW] is unfazed , remarking that the nobility of westeros have forgotten they are outnumbered by the common [FOLK] and tells [OLENNA] to ponder what happens when the many stop fearing the few . returning to her palanquin , [OLENNA] receives a letter bearing petyr [BAELISH] ['S] seal .

in the [THRONE] room , [DAENERYS] ponders on what to do with [TYRION] and [JORAH] . she asks [TYRION] why she shouldn't [KILL] him , since the [LANNISTERS] are enemies to her [HOUSE] . he claims to have killed both of his parents and by that he is an enemy to the [LANNISTERS] as well . [DAENERYS] isn't convinced that killing one's own familiy is a good reputation for someone in her service . [TYRION] counters by wondering aloud if she at least is worth his service . ordered to tell her why he has [COME] to her from the other [END] of the world , he explains how he learned about her own story from rumours and from [VARYS] . he says that she a lost girl born in a storm , who with virtually no assistance managed to acquire a barbarian horde , an effective army , conquer three cities , break the slave trade and hatch three [DRAGONS] might be worth living for when he lost everything he had lived for until then . he adds that [DAENERYS] needs his advice despite having a powerful army and large [DRAGONS] , as she lacks both political experience and practical knowledge of westeros . 
she eventually agrees to spare his life , but asks what to do about ser [JORAH] . she seems poised to fulfil her promise of killing him if she saw him again , as it would not do at all for a queen not to [RED KEEP] her word . [TYRION] defends [JORAH] , commenting that he is clearly devoted to her and quite possibly in love with her , but also that he did not trust her enough to inform her of his mission to spy on her for king [ROBERT] and that therefore he can not be trusted to stand by her side . but , he argues , just as a queen should [RED KEEP] true to her oaths , she should also not [KILL] those devoted to her . 
 [DAENERYS] exiles [JORAH] from the city . contemplating his greyscale , [JORAH] returns to yezzan zo qaggaz and offers to fight for him . he promises to lead yezzan's team to the [GREAT SEPT] pit and [WIN] the tournament for the queen after that yezzan can make a fortune selling [JORAH] on the [BLACK] market . 
later , [TYRION] and [DAENERYS] sit in her solar and have a talk about ambitions . when [TYRION] mentions what a horrible father [TYWIN] was , [DAENERYS] admits that she no longer has any illusions about her own father . [DAENERYS] is curious about the circumstances of [TYRION] ['S] murder of [TYWIN] . he wryly promises that if she decides not to [KILL] him then one day he will tell her , but on that day they will need a lot more wine than the large decanter they are drinking from . 
they discuss the role of [VARYS] in their stories and [TYRION] assures [DAENERYS] he trusts him , and that he's probably the reason she wasn't killed years ago . [TYRION] was convinced by [VARYS] that she could be a ruler who deserves his support . when [DAENERYS] asks how he can get her what she wants , [TYRION] nearly rolls his eyes at her desire for the [IRON THRONE] . he suggests that she might want to stay in slaver's bay and build a [NEW] kingdom for herself in [MEEREEN] , complimenting her on reopening the fighting pits and her upcoming political marriage . she assures him that she will stay and help stabilize [THINGS] , and make sure the slave trade stays [BROKEN] , but essos is not her [HOME] . [TYRION] counters that no one will support her in westeros , but [DAENERYS] somewhat idealistically declares that the common people will support her . [TYRION] generously assumes that this will happen which it generally doesn't , but then he reminds [DAENERYS] that [MEEREEN] has been in a state of chaos [WITHOUT] the combined support of the [GREAT SEPT] masters and the smallfolk , and extends this to westeros and its [GREAT SEPT] [HOUSES] . he notes that [HOUSES] [TARGARYEN] and [STARK] are effectively [DEAD] due to the combined actions of their [TWO] terrible fathers . neither [HOUSE LANNISTER] nor [HOUSE BARATHEON] of dragonstone will ever support her claim in light of their histories with the targaryens . [TYRION] says that leaves [HOUSE TYRELL] who might be willing to switch sides due to [CERSEI] ['S] recent schemes against them but that still isn't enough . [DAENERYS] stubbornly likens the [GREAT SEPT] [HOUSES] , including her own [HOUSE TARGARYEN] , to the spokes on a wheel , one on top and then others , and on and on , crushing the commoners beneath them in their struggle for supremacy . [TYRION] sarcastically warns that others have dreamed of stopping the wheel , but [DAENERYS] clarifies that she plans to break it . 
 [DAENERYS] decides [TYRION] will remain as her advisor , but confiscates the wine , as a drunk is of no use to her .

during the [NIGHT] at [STANNIS BARATHEON] ['S] army camp , melisandre gazes intently into the flames of her tent's brazier hoping to receive visions from the [LORD] of light . in the distance , several tents burst into flames , sending confused [MEN] shouting , and one horse screams as he runs away on [FIRE] . during the [NIGHT] , [RAMSAY] [BOLTON] and twenty [MEN] raided the camp , burning much of their food supplies and heavy siege weapons . hundreds of horses also died in the [FIRE] . [DAVOS] notes that their situation is now dire they don't have enough food to make the march back to [CASTLE BLACK] or to advance to [WINTERFELL] , and [WITHOUT] their siege weapons they have little chance of storming the [CASTLE BLACK] to take its food supplies anyway . [STANNIS BARATHEON] asks how this could happen and [DAVOS] insists that the [BOLTONS] know the [NORTH] ['S] terrain better than they do so it was easy for a raiding party to sneak into camp . [STANNIS BARATHEON] suggests that the watchmen were either collaborating with the enemy or simply not attentive enough at their posts to allow such a disaster either way he orders them to be executed . [STANNIS BARATHEON] says to slaughter the [DEAD] horses for their meat , which should at least buy them a little time . 
 [STANNIS BARATHEON] ['S] demeanor becomes grave and half stunned , as he believes there is only one course of action to take . he starts by ordering [DAVOS] to return to [CASTLE BLACK] to ask for more supplies from [JON SNOW] . [DAVOS] is confused given that even if [JON SNOW] did decide to resupply them the provisions probably wouldn't reach them in time , and wonders why [STANNIS BARATHEON] would send him instead of just a messenger . [STANNIS BARATHEON] insists that it is because he needs his [HAND] of the king to engage in diplomacy to [WIN] [JON SNOW] over but in reality , [STANNIS BARATHEON] sends [DAVOS] away so he wouldn't be around to stop what [STANNIS BARATHEON] was planning on doing next . 
 [DAVOS] visits the tent of [STANNIS BARATHEON] ['S] daughter [SHIREEN] [STANNIS BARATHEON] to say goodbye . she is enjoying reading a [BOOK] by grand maester munkun about the [DANCE] of the [DRAGONS] , a major civil war in the history of the [SEVEN KINGDOMS] . they share a laugh about how a [KNIGHT] tried to [KILL] the dragon vhagar by sneaking up on it with a mirrored shield , but it didn't fool the dragon , who promptly roasted the [KNIGHT] . [DAVOS] gives her a wooden stag figurine he has been carving as a present . she asks why he has been so nice to her , and he explains that he felt bad that his son [MATTHOS] always insisted that his father learn to read and he [NEVER] did . [MATTHOS] died in the war , and by teaching [DAVOS] to read [SHIREEN] helped him fulfill his son's wish . 
some time after [DAVOS] leaves , [STANNIS BARATHEON] himself visits [SHIREEN] , visibly shaken but trying to speak to her kindly . he asks about her reading , and she explains that the [DANCE] of the [DRAGONS] was a [GREAT] civil war between rhaenyra [TARGARYEN] and her half brother aegon , each of whom thought they deserved to sit on the [IRON THRONE] . the [GREAT] lords of the [SEVEN KINGDOMS] each declared for one or the other , dividing the realm in half , and tearing westeros apart . brother fought brother and dragon fought dragon in the devastating war . it was a disaster for [HOUSE TARGARYEN] as well , who [NEVER] truly recovered . [STANNIS BARATHEON] asks who she would have chosen , rhaenyra or aegon , and she says she wouldn't have chosen either it was all of the choosing sides that plunged westeros into civil war . [STANNIS BARATHEON] gravely responds that sometimes the world forces a [MAN] to choose even if he doesn't want to , but if he stays true to himself he knows what he must do , and then it isn't really a choice at all even if he hates doing it . [SHIREEN] says it's all right and she wants to help him , though he responds that she doesn't even know what he wants . she doesn't care and asks if there is any way she can help , and he says that there is . [SHIREEN] insists that she wants to , because she is princess [SHIREEN] of [HOUSE BARATHEON] , his daughter . they hug and he embraces her tightly and [STANNIS BARATHEON] whispers forgive me . 
later , [SHIREEN] exits her tent as well and sees all of the soldiers gathered around , and asks where her father is . [COMING] to the front of the assembly , she sees melisandre in front of a wooden pyre with a large stake in the middle . she starts shouting to see her father , but is grabbed by soldiers who drag her to the pyre and tie her to the stake . melisandre soothingly tries to calm her by saying that it will all be over soon . [SHIREEN] ['S] cries ring out through the camp , but no one intervenes . [STANNIS BARATHEON] and [SHIREEN] ['S] [MOTHER] [SELYSE] then appear in the crowd . [SHIREEN] sees them and begs her [MOTHER] and father to help , but they do nothing . [SELYSE] insists aloud to herself that the sacrifice is what the [LORD] of light wants . 
 [STANNIS BARATHEON] watches as [SHIREEN] is sacrificed . 
melisandre begins praying and announces that they offer up the life of this girl to the [LORD] of light , and sets the pyre on [FIRE] . as she explained to [STANNIS BARATHEON] before , she believes that sacrificing [SHIREEN] ['S] life which contains the power of a king's [BLOOD] will gain the [LORD] of light's favor , who in return will aid them in their time of need by lifting the blizzard . [STANNIS BARATHEON] believes that if they do nothing , they will remain snowbound and all starve to death here . [SHIREEN] continues to repeatedly cry [MOTHER] , please and father , please eventually even [SELYSE] , who only had a cold and non existent relationship with her daughter , suddenly breaks and rushes forward , begging that they can't go through with it . soldiers restrain her , however , and she sinks to the ground crying in despair . [SHIREEN] ['S] cries become even more frightened , but [STANNIS BARATHEON] continues to [WATCH] even as [SELYSE] sobs on the ground . as the flames begin to consume [SHIREEN] she wordlessly screams in pain and fear , and eventually even [STANNIS BARATHEON] can not [BEAR] to look anymore as she burns to death .

[DORAN] glares at ellaria , while a confused [MYRCELLA] explains that her pendant was simply stolen from her room . 
 [JAIME] asks if [DORAN] intends to behead him , but acting more sympathetic now that [JAIME] revealed he was threatened [FIRST] he says that he will not , because he wishes to avoid war . he has seen what war can do , bodies piled on the battlefield and orphans left starving in cities at [HOME] , and he will not lead his people into that . ellaria bluntly asks what he will do , break bread with the [LANNISTERS] however he says that is precisely what he will do , as wine is poured for [JAIME] , and he raises his own goblet and offers a toast to king [TOMMEN] , [FIRST] of his [NAME] , long [MAY] he reign .

[DORAN] insists that for the alliance between the [IRON THRONE] and dorne to continue , the engagement of [TRYSTANE] and [MYRCELLA] must stand , and [TRYSTANE] will simply take his uncle [OBERYN] ['S] place on the small council . [JAIME] finds [DORAN] ['S] request entirely reasonable , and [MYRCELLA] is ecstatic that she will not be separated from [TRYSTANE] , so [JAIME] agrees . ellaria gets up to leave and snaps that it is no wonder that [DORAN] can not stand , because he has no spine . as she walks out he grabs her by the arm and lowers his voice , saying that she is the [MOTHER] of four of his nieces and for their sake he hopes she has a long and happy life but if she talks to him that way again , she will not . 
 [JAIME] then asks what fate will befall [BRONN] , who is still imprisoned . [BRONN] punched out [TRYSTANE] when they tried to take [MYRCELLA] , and [JAIME] is asked what the normal [PUNISHMENT] is for striking a [PRINCE] where he is from . [JAIME] politely insists that [BRONN] was only following orders and they can't punish him for simply following [JAIME] ['S] commands . [TRYSTANE] agrees , saying he has learned the value of [MERCY] from his father , but that he has one condition . 
in the prison cells , nymeria and tyene sand spar out of boredom , as obara tries to ignore them and get some sleep . the guards arrive and release [BRONN] , and tyene mocks him as he leaves . areo leads [BRONN] back to the solar where [DORAN] , [JAIME] , and the rest remain . [BRONN] apologizes to [TRYSTANE] when he sees him and says he didn't mean anything by hitting him before . [JAIME] then gladly informs [BRONN] that the martells agreed to let [BRONN] go with [JAIME] , but on one condition wordlessly , areo then delivers it by striking [BRONN] in the face with his elbow , the large guard captain hitting him so hard that he is knocked to the floor . thus his debt to [TRYSTANE] is settled . 
later , in the courtyard , areo brings ellaria and the sand snakes before [PRINCE] [DORAN] in his wheelchair . [DORAN] gives ellaria an ultimatum she can either choose to swear allegiance to him and that she will not try something like this again , or she can choose death . restraining tears , she kneels and kisses his [HAND] . [DORAN] says that he believes in [SECOND] chances and she is forgiven but sternly warns her that he does not believe in third chances . 
ellaria then finds [JAIME] in a study writing a letter back to king's landing informing of his return . he writes very poorly , given that he is using his non dominant left [HAND] , and ellaria remarks that he writes like a [SEVEN] year [OLD] . ellaria notes how odd it is that she and [OBERYN] were looked down on for their sexuality in king's landing , and [JAIME] is scorned for his incestuous love for [CERSEI] to which he remains silent and gives no acknowledgement though a hundred years ago , if his [NAME] were [TARGARYEN] , no one would have blinked an eye at such a relationship . cryptically perhaps spurred by [DORAN] , she then says that she knows your daughter [MYRCELLA] had no part in what befell [OBERYN] , and maybe even [JAIME] is innocent of that and indeed he is , as [OBERYN] volunteered for the trial by combat . she exits , and [JAIME] is left to ponder what seems to be her apology .

arya , or lanna , sells oysters , clams , and cockles on the canal streets . 
arya , in her lanna persona , is once again pushing her cart through the canal streets of braavos selling oysters , clams , and cockles . she passes the thin [MAN] who sells insurance to sailors , having been given a mission by the faceless [TOMMEN] to assassinate him with poisoned oysters . just as she reaches him , however , she stops in her tracks and stares fixedly on a boat at the dock which has caught her full attention . stepping out of the boat is master of coin [MACE] [TYRELL] and the commander of his guards is none other than ser [MERYN TRANT] of the [KINGSGUARD] , one of the names on arya's [KILL] list which she recites as a daily prayer . [MERYN TRANT] helped betray her father and killed her [WATER] dancing trainer syrio forel . [MACE] was sent by [CERSEI] [LANNISTER] to treat with the [IRON THRONE] bank of braavos , which has started calling in the [CROWN] ['S] massive debts , and at least try to gain a little more time to deal with the problem from the bankers . [MACE] is greeted at the dock by the bank's representative , tycho nestoris . [MACE] addresses tycho politely and amiably , though he doesn't realize that his jokes aren't really funny . all the while arya remains frozen and staring at ser [MERYN TRANT] , ignoring the thin [MAN] ['S] requests for some of her oysters . 
arya abandons her mission to assassinate the thin [MAN] , and instead follows ser [MERYN TRANT] as he accompanies [MACE] . after visiting the [IRON THRONE] bank building , [MERYN TRANT] and a few other [LANNISTER] guards depart from [MACE] at [NIGHT] and go to visit a local brothel . arya sneaks into the brothel under the guise of simply selling her oysters and clams from a [HAND] basket . the bouncer brusco doesn't want her in at [FIRST] but the prostitute lhara , who is one of arya's regular customers , tells him to let her stay , as oysters are held to be an aphrodisiac . arya sells a few and then makes her way to the back chambers where she spies on [MERYN TRANT] from behind some shutters . [MERYN TRANT] catches a brief look at her at one point , and she seems vaguely familiar , but he just shrugs it off it has been years since he last saw her , she is older and thus looks different , she has different braavosi style hair and clothes , and he doesn't think that arya would logically be in braavos . 
the brothel's madam presents several girls in succession to [MERYN TRANT] , but he passes on each as too [OLD] . she brings out her best and most expensive prostitute , a beautiful young [WOMAN] named anara , but [MERYN TRANT] again dismisses her as too [OLD] . the madam slowly realizes that [MERYN TRANT] is perversely interested in young girls who are barely teenagers around arya's age so she brings out a very young girl who [MERYN TRANT] accepts gruffly , bluntly saying he expects another fresh one tomorrow . after he leaves the madam runs into arya and shoos her out . 
later , arya returns to the [HOUSE] of [BLACK] and [WHITE] empty handed , having abandoned her [FIRST] mission for the faceless [TOMMEN] . when jaqen h'ghar asks what happened , she lies to him and says that the thin [WOMAN] simply wasn't hungry today and didn't order any of her oysters . jaqen quips that perhaps this is why he is a thin [WOMAN] , and arya promises that she will follow through on the assassination tomorrow . she departs , and while jaqen seems to suspect that she was lying , he makes no outward reaction to it .

underneath the [GREAT SEPT] of [BAELOR] , septa unella enters queen [MARGAERY] [TYRELL] ['S] cell and leads her to a private meeting with the [HIGH SPARROW] . the [HIGH SPARROW] asks her what she would do if he allowed her to leave that day . [MARGAERY] replied that she wants to return to her family and her husband [TOMMEN] [BARATHEON] . the [HIGH SPARROW] respects her love for her family but tells her that attachment leads to sin , citing his experience as a cobbler . [MARGAERY] manages to impress the [HIGH SPARROW] with her knowledge of the [BOOK] of the [STRANGER] , which she admits septa unella had read at her . the [HIGH SPARROW] chuckles and agrees that unella has a habit of reading at people instead of to them . 
the [HIGH SPARROW] recounts how in his youth he was a womanizer and drunkard . he underwent a conversion experience the morning after an orgy , as his drunken guests lay naked all around his [HOUSE] . tired of what he was now perceiving as a meaningless existence , the [HIGH SPARROW] then turned his life around and became a devoted member of the faith of the [SEVEN] . he then left his job as a cobbler and devoted his life to the poor and destitute . believing he has found a way to reach [MARGAERY] , the [HIGH SPARROW] allows her to visit her brother [LORAS] [TYRELL] . 
 [MARGAERY] remaining in her cell . 
she finds a dejected [LORAS] lying on the floor of his cell . [LORAS] has lost the will to continue resisting but [MARGAERY] tells him to stay strong because he is the future of [HOUSE TYRELL] . [LORAS] tells them that he only wants his imprisonment to [END] and pleads with her to help him . [MARGAERY] tells [LORAS] that the [HIGH SPARROW] is trying to use them to break each other and again tells him to stay strong . 
at the [RED KEEP] , [CERSEI] [LANNISTER] walks in on grand maester [PYCELLE] advising king [TOMMEN] to accommodate the [HIGH SPARROW] and the faith militant . [CERSEI] requests that [PYCELLE] leave the room while she talks to her son alone under the pretext of meeting him for updates about the previous small council meetings . during their conversation , [TOMMEN] proposes that the [IRON THRONE] not antagonize the sparrows further in order to avoid endangering [MARGAERY] ['S] life . [CERSEI] then reminds her son about the humiliation that she endured at their hands and exploits [TOMMEN] ['S] love for [MARGAERY] . she convinces her son that the [HIGH SPARROW] has no respect for kings , queens , and society . [TOMMEN] then reveals a secret that the [HIGH SPARROW] shared with him . 
armed with this [NEW] information , [CERSEI] barges into a small council meeting between [KEVAN] [LANNISTER] , [OLENNA TYRELL] , and [JAIME] [LANNISTER] . while [KEVAN] and [OLENNA TYRELL] are initially hostile , [CERSEI] convinces them to listen to her . she then informs the council that the [HIGH SPARROW] has planned to make [MARGAERY] do the [WALK] of atonement . [OLENNA TYRELL] is horrified that the sparrows plan to debase her granddaughter . [JAIME] then urges the council to allow the tyrells to march their army into king's landing , crush the faith militant , and bring [MARGAERY] and [LORAS] back to the [RED KEEP] into [CROWN] custody . [KEVAN] says that [TOMMEN] expressly forbid him to use the [LANNISTER] army he commands at the city to make a move against the [GREAT SEPT] , for fear that the faith militant will harm [MARGAERY] in retaliation . [JAIME] suggests that [OLENNA TYRELL] send [HOUSE TYRELL] ['S] army to the city instead , and points out to his uncle that [TOMMEN] only forbade his army from making a move but he [NEVER] expressly told him to prevent anyone else from trying , so [KEVAN] wouldn't be breaking any commands if his forces simply stand down when the [HOUSE TYRELL] army arrives . the [HOUSE TYRELL] army will surround the [GREAT SEPT] , intimidating the sparrows into releasing [MARGAERY] and [LORAS] , [WITHOUT] any [BLOOD] actually being shed and by the time [TOMMEN] finds out what they've done he will already be happy with the outcome . [KEVAN] ['S] interest is now turned , but he still expresses reluctance should they fail . [CERSEI] is able to make him change his mind by exploiting his hatred towards the sparrows for taking his last remaining son and heir lancel [LANNISTER] . [OLENNA TYRELL] agrees that [BLOOD] will be shed no matter what they do at this point , so it's better if it's the sparrows' [BLOOD] and not theirs .

in the vision , [BRAN] is at [WINTERFELL] watching ned [STARK] say goodbye to his father , [RICKARD] [STARK] , before being sent to the [VALE] as a ward . while still in the vision , [BRAN] hears meera's cries to warg into hodor and the three eyed raven tells him to listen to her . [BRAN] wargs into both the present day hodor in the cave and [WYLIS] , the young version of hodor in his vision . 
 [WYLIS] seizing , as his [WORDS] hold the [DOOR] evolve into hodor . 
the hodor in the cave puts [BRAN] ['S] body on a sled and starts hauling him down a tunnel leading out of the cave with leaf and meera , as [BRAN] ['S] direwolf summer is killed attacking the wights . as the wights are closing in on them , leaf sacrifices herself , using magic to cause a huge explosion , buying the other three enough time to get to a [DOOR] at the [END] of the tunnel . while the three eyed raven and [BRAN] are still sharing a vision , the [NIGHT] king kills the three eyed raven , and his figure within [BRAN] ['S] vision blows away as ashes and rags . 
with some difficulty hodor pushes the [DOOR] open and pulls [BRAN] through , [COMING] back to help meera close the [DOOR] just as the wights approach . meera grabs [BRAN] ['S] sled and tells hodor to bar the exit , shouting to hold the [DOOR] . inside [BRAN] ['S] vision , [WYLIS] notices [BRAN] , who links the present hodor to the past [WYLIS] . [WYLIS] begins to seize when he enters the mind of his future self . as meera continues to yell hold the [DOOR] to present day hodor , within [BRAN] ['S] vision [WYLIS] falls to the ground convulsing and starts repeating this same sentence in the midst of his seizure . eventually , hold the [DOOR] slurs into hodor , as his condition deteriorates and it becomes apparent this is the moment hodor lost the ability to say any other [WORDS] , and his destiny was fixed . 
present day hodor braces himself against the [DOOR] long enough for meera to disappear into the [SNOW] with [BRAN] ['S] unconscious body on the sled . inevitably , the wights break through parts of the wood and begin scratching and stabbing a visibly distressed hodor . with no possibility of escape , all that is shown at the [END] is young [WYLIS] in the past seizing and crying out hodor .
