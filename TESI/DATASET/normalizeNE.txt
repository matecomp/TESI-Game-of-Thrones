 <NED STARK> draws his sword . 
some time later , will has fled <SOUTH> of the wall in terror , rather than return to warn <CASTLE BLACK> of the white walker threat . he is apprehended by outriders loyal to <HOUSE STARK> , the wardens of the north , and is taken to lord <EDDARD STARK> . lord <EDDARD STARK> , in the courtyard watching his son , <BRAN STARK> at archery training , decrees that as a deserter from the watch , will is an <OATHBREAKER> and must die . will accepts his fate , but tells <EDDARD STARK> about the walkers first and asks that word be sent back to his mother . <EDDARD STARK> carries out the execution himself , using the ancestral <VALYRIAN> blade of their <HOUSE STARK> , <ICE> . two of <EDDARD STARK>'s trueborn sons , 17 year old robb and 10 year old <BRAN STARK> , accompany him to the execution along with his bastard son <JON SNOW> , his ward , <THEON GREYJOY> , the master at arms <RODRIK CASSEL> and his leading guard <JORY CASSEL> . young <BRAN STARK> witnesses an execution for the first time without flinching , earning praise from <JON SNOW> . <EDDARD STARK> explains to <BRAN STARK> that the reason he was made to execute will was because the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword . when <BRAN STARK> asks his father about will's talk of <WHITE WALKERS> , <EDDARD STARK> dismisses it as a madman's ramblings , insisting that the <WHITE WALKERS> have been gone for centuries . the party sets out to return to winterfell . 
the <STARKS> come across the direwolves . 
on the way back to the <CASTLE BLACK> , the party finds a stag dead in the road , partially disemboweled . looking for what killed it , they find a dead female direwolf , killed with a stag antler piece broken off in her throat . the female died after giving birth , and her five pups huddle by the corpse for warmth . <THEON GREYJOY> advocates killing the pups , but <JON SNOW> convinces his father that this is an omen the direwolf is the symbol of <HOUSE STARK> , and <EDDARD STARK> has five trueborn children . with <BRAN STARK> looking on beseechingly , <EDDARD STARK> agrees that his children should have the pups , but only if they raise them themselves with no help from the servants . just as the party leaves , <JON SNOW> finds a sixth pup , an albino runt of the litter . <THEON GREYJOY> mockingly points out that this one belongs to <JON SNOW> . 
in king's <LANDING> , the capital city of the <SEVEN KINGDOMS> , the bells ring out to commemorate the death of lord <JON ARRYN> , the <HAND> of the king . as the <SILENT SISTERS> prepare his body for burial , queen <CERSEI LANNISTER> looks on . she is worried that <JON ARRYN> discovered something he shouldn't have , and may have told someone . she confesses her fears to her twin brother , ser <JAIME LANNISTER> of the <KINGSGUARD> , but he tells her not to worry , since if the king knew the truth they'd be dead already . she tells him he should be the new <HAND> of the king , but he doesn't want the job . he considers it too much work . <CERSEI LANNISTER> accuses him of taking nothing seriously . 
a raven bears news of <JON ARRYN>'s death to winterfell , where lady <CATELYN STARK> informs <EDDARD STARK> . he is particularly stricken because <JON ARRYN> served as a father figure to him , when he was fostered at the <EYRIE> . she also tells him that king <ROBERT BARATHEON> and much of the royal court rides for winterfell . <EDDARD STARK> realizes that king <ROBERT BARATHEON> means to name him as the <HAND> to replace <JON ARRYN> . he ponders refusing , feeling his place is at winterfell . 
over the next few weeks the <EDDARD STARK> children grow used to their rapidly growing direwolves robb names his <GREY WIND> , sansa calls hers lady , and arya names hers <NYMERIA> after a great warrior queen . <JON ARRYN> names his ghost , for his <WHITE WALKERS> color and uncanny silence . <BRAN STARK> calls his <SUMMER> and six year old <RICKON> names his wolf <SHAGGYDOG> . <BRAN STARK>'s mother catches him climbing on the rooftops of the <CASTLE BLACK> , just as the royal party comes into view . he promises to stop , but his mother knows he is lying . winterfell prepares for guests . <CATELYN STARK> wants to make sure that <TYRION LANNISTER> , a great reader , has enough candles , and the young men of the <HOUSE STARK> get groomed , as they gossip about the queen , a reportedly great beauty . 
winterfell gathers to greet the royal party . 
all of winterfell gathers in the courtyard as the royal party approaches . arya is late and annoys sansa by not being <SILENT SISTERS> and respectful when they arrive . king <ROBERT BARATHEON> rides in with his knights , while queen <CERSEI LANNISTER> is in a large wheelhouse . lord <EDDARD STARK> presents his household to king <ROBERT BARATHEON> . <EDDARD STARK> and <ROBERT BARATHEON> greet each other warmly , and then <ROBERT BARATHEON> demands to see the crypts and pay his respects to <EDDARD STARK>'s deceased sister , lyanna , much to queen <CERSEI LANNISTER>'s impatience . after <ROBERT BARATHEON> and <EDDARD STARK> depart , <CERSEI LANNISTER> sends <JAIME LANNISTER> to find their younger brother <TYRION LANNISTER> , who is a dwarf . the <IMP> has found his way to the brothel in the <TOWN> <OUTSIDE> winterfell , where he enjoys the attentions of a prostitute named ros . <JAIME LANNISTER> tells <TYRION LANNISTER> , a man of limited height but with immense appetites , that he will be needed at the feast that night . <JAIME LANNISTER> has hired three more prostitutes for <TYRION LANNISTER> , to hurry things along .

in the crypts <ROBERT BARATHEON> offers up his prayers at the tomb of <LYANNA STARK> , <EDDARD STARK>'s younger sister , whom <ROBERT BARATHEON> was betrothed to before she was kidnapped by prince <RHAEGAR TARGARYEN> and died shortly after being rescued . he tells <EDDARD STARK> that in his dreams he kills <RHAEGAR TARGARYEN> every night anew . <EDDARD STARK> reminds him that <HOUSE TARGARYEN> was destroyed , but <ROBERT BARATHEON> replies not all of them . 
 <ROBERT BARATHEON> formally offers <EDDARD STARK> the role of <HAND> , and <EDDARD STARK> asks for time to consider . <ROBERT BARATHEON> agrees , but offers a sweetener the <HAND> of his son , joffrey , in marriage to <EDDARD STARK>'s daughter , sansa . a great feast is held and <CERSEI LANNISTER> and <CATELYN STARK> exchange cordial words . <CERSEI LANNISTER> seems more impressed by sansa , thinking that she will be a great hit at court . <OUTSIDE> the feast , <JON SNOW> works at his sword practice , angry that <CATELYN STARK> thought it would be inappropriate that a bastard should attend . his uncle <BENJEN> <CATELYN STARK> , first ranger of the night's watch , arrives to join the feast , and <JON SNOW> asks him to take him back to the wall with him . <BENJEN> agrees to consider it . <TYRION LANNISTER> then arrives and talks to <JON SNOW> , suggesting that he is too pricklish and quick to take offense when his illegitimacy is pointed out . he should take the insult and wear it like armor , so that no one can hurt him with it . when <JON SNOW> angrily asks <TYRION LANNISTER> what he knows about it , <TYRION LANNISTER> replies that all dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes . 
 <EDDARD STARK> and <CATELYN STARK> receive a letter in the night , delivered to maester <LUWIN> by a messenger from the <EYRIE> . the letter is from <CATELYN STARK>'s sister , lady <LYSA ARRYN> , the widow of <JON ARRYN> . in the letter , <LYSA ARRYN> says that <JON ARRYN> was murdered by the <LANNISTERS> and that they plan to conspire against king <ROBERT BARATHEON> . <LUWIN> counsels that <EDDARD STARK> should accept <ROBERT BARATHEON>'s offer to be <HAND> , so he can investigate the truth of the matter and protect the king . <EDDARD STARK> , while he would prefer to stay at winterfell , agrees with <LUWIN> and accepts the offer . 
the next morning <EDDARD STARK> and <ROBERT BARATHEON> go hunting , leaving the <CASTLE BLACK> largely empty . <BRAN STARK> indulges in some climbing but , while climbing a <BROKEN TOWER> , he hears someone moaning . he peers through a window and finds the queen and her brother engaged in a sexual act . <CERSEI LANNISTER> spots him and warns <JAIME LANNISTER> , who grabs <BRAN STARK> . <JAIME LANNISTER> looks out the window to make sure nobody else is watching and only sees <SUMMER> . he turns to <BRAN STARK> and asks how old he is . when <BRAN STARK> replies ten , <JAIME LANNISTER> remarks with a sigh , the things i do for love . with that , he pushes <BRAN STARK> out of the window .

 <EDDARD STARK> is stunned to learn that the crown is six million gold dragons in debt , half of which is to lord <TYWIN LANNISTER> . to make matters worse , king <ROBERT BARATHEON> has just ordered a lavish tournament to celebrate <EDDARD STARK>'s appointment . he resolves to advise <ROBERT BARATHEON> to cancel the tournament , but the <SMALL COUNCIL> is doubtful that the king will listen .

arya and <SANSA STARK> are still at odds over the incident with joffrey and her direwolf . <EDDARD STARK> explains that <SANSA STARK> was put in a difficult position by the king and queen , and while she shouldn't have lied , winning the long term approval of joffrey , her future husband , was important . arya is unhappy with the situation , but <EDDARD STARK> mollifies her by allowing her to practice with her sword , <NEEDLE> . 
 <CATELYN STARK> and <RODRIK CASSEL> arrive in king's <LANDING> . <CATELYN STARK> and ser <RODRIK CASSEL> arrive at king's <LANDING> and attempt to sneak into the city , but are spotted by one of <LITTLEFINGER>'s men . they are taken to meet <LITTLEFINGER> at a brothel he owns , where lord <VARYS> is also waiting one of his'little birds' told him they were coming . <CATELYN STARK> is angered by the way they've been treated , but asks <LITTLEFINGER> for aid in finding the people who tried to have <BRAN STARK> killed . <LITTLEFINGER> is able to answer this quickly the elaborate dagger wielded by the assassin used to be his , but he lost it in a gamble with <TYRION LANNISTER> . 
 <EDDARD STARK> threatens lord baelish . 
 <LITTLEFINGER> fetches <EDDARD STARK> to meet his wife , but <EDDARD STARK> suspects a trick and pushes <LITTLEFINGER> up against a wall <OUTSIDE> the brothel wanting to know what his game is . <CATELYN STARK> then appears , and <EDDARD STARK> is pacified . after hearing her news , he vows to find the truth and expose the <LANNISTERS> to <ROBERT BARATHEON> . <LITTLEFINGER> agrees to be his ally in this , for the affection he once bore <CATELYN STARK> as a youngster .

elsewhere , <ROBERT BARATHEON> swaps old war stories with ser <BARRISTAN SELMY> , a distinguished and famous knight and the commander of the <KINGSGUARD> . summoning <JAIME LANNISTER> , <ROBERT BARATHEON> jokingly questions him about <AERYS TARGARYEN>'s death , wondering if the <MAD> king died begging for mercy , but <JAIME LANNISTER> rather coldly replies that the master he betrayed died screaming the same words he'd been saying since the <SIEGE> of king's <LANDING> began burn them all . 
 <EDDARD STARK> has contracted a swordmaster , <SYRIO FOREL> , the former first sword of <BRAAVOS> , to teach arya how to use her sword properly . arya is thrilled , and'the dance' begins . as <EDDARD STARK> watches them practice , his pleasure at seeing arya happy sours when he realizes that a conflict between the <STARKS> and <LANNISTERS> may be inevitable his daughter may well be training herself for war .

when <BRAN STARK> arrives , <TYRION LANNISTER> sympathizes with <BRAN STARK> for being a cripple , which annoys <BRAN STARK> , as does asking him if he likes to ride , but <TYRION LANNISTER> simply says it is the truth , no less so for being a hard truth . he gives the <STARKS> the design of a saddle which will allow <BRAN STARK> to ride even in his current state . he does it to repay <BRAN STARK>'s half brother's friendship and because he has a weakness for , <CRIPPLES> , bastards and broken things . due to this kindness , <ROBB STARK> says he can stay , but <TYRION LANNISTER> says he would prefer the brothel in <TOWN> . while preparing to leave the <CASTLE BLACK> , <THEON GREYJOY> comes to <TYRION LANNISTER> and rather condescendingly sends him off , recommending the prostitute ros at the brothel . <TYRION LANNISTER> asks <THEON GREYJOY> why lady <CATELYN STARK> was not present to receive him and concludes that <CATELYN STARK> is not in winterfell . he also taunts <THEON GREYJOY> about how the son of the ferocious <BALON GREYJOY> has been reduced to playing lackey in winterfell to his captors , which infuriates <THEON GREYJOY> and gives him a coin , assuming that he has not already had sex with ros .

 <VISERYS> is enraged when daenerys sends <DOREAH> with an invite for him to dine with her , as he interprets this as his sister commanding him to come . he drags <DOREAH> into daenerys' tent , and insults her dinner and the gifts of clothes she tries to give him . he is still dressed in his now ragged clothes from <PENTOS> , having refused to dress like a dothraki , whom he regards as savage pordh . he sneers that next she will try to braid his hair like a dothraki . daenerys retorts that he has no right to braid his hair until he is victorious in <BATTLE> , which further infuriates him . in his anger , <VISERYS> tackles her to the ground and tries to strike her , calling her nothing but a horselord's slut , and warning her that she's awoken the dragon , but this time she fights back , hitting him in the face with a metal and leather belt . she tells a thunderstruck <VISERYS> that she is the <KHAL DROGO>'s wife , and is carrying his child and by implication , <VISERYS> is nothing to the dothraki , and warns that if he raises a <HAND> against her again , he will lose his hands . later , daenerys confides in mormont her realization that <VISERYS> will never become king of <WESTEROS> . he is so weak and ineffectual that he couldn't command an <ARMY> even if <KHAL DROGO> gave him one , to which jorah agrees .

taking the book with him , eddard comes across arya in the hall standing on one leg as part of her training with syrio . arya asks whether <BRAN STARK> would be able to live in king's <LANDING> with them now that he's awoken , but eddard states that he would have to regain his strength first . arya then comments that <BRAN STARK> had always wanted to be a knight in the king's guard , but will no longer be able to due to his paralysis . eddard confirms this to be the case , but states that <BRAN STARK> will be able to do many other things such as become lord of a holdfast , sit on the king's <SMALL COUNCIL> , or raise castles . when arya asks if she would be able to become any of those , eddard instead tells her that she will marry a highborn lord and have lords and princes for sons . however , arya is not pleased with this response , telling her father , that's not me . she goes back to balancing on one leg as eddard looks on . 
 <PETYR> talks with eddard . <LITTLEFINGER> meets with eddard and suggests that he <RED KEEP> his investigation into <JON ARRYN>'s death lower in profile . he also gives eddard some interesting intelligence <JON ARRYN>'s former squire has been knighted and will fight in the forthcoming <HAND>'s tourney . he also advises him to investigate an armorer located in the city . eddard decides that <LITTLEFINGER> may be more trustworthy than he first thought , but <LITTLEFINGER> discourages him from thinking that way . eddard sends <JORY CASSEL> to question <JON ARRYN>'s former squire , ser <HUGH> of the <VALE> . however , deducing that <JORY CASSEL> was not a knight , ser <HUGH> simply rebuffs him and refuses to speak with him due to his much lower rank . eddard's investigation leads him to a smithy in the city , where he meets master smith tobho mott and his apprentice <GENDRY> , whose work <JON ARRYN> was also apparently interested in . eddard realizes that <GENDRY> is one of king robert's bastard sons , but can't work out why <JON ARRYN> would be interested in this robert has many bastard children and shows little interest in any of them . 
later , eddard sends <JORY CASSEL> with a message for king robert , but upon arriving at his quarters , the sounds of many women can he heard coming from robert's chamber . ser <JAIME LANNISTER> happens to be on duty and is angry that the king keeps him guarding his chamber while he cavorts with other women inside , flaunting his dishonorable treatment of <JAIME LANNISTER>'s sister in his face . he and <JORY CASSEL> reminisce about the greyjoy <REBELLION> , in which they both fought for king robert's forces to put down an attempt by <BALON GREYJOY> theon's father to secede the <IRON ISLANDS> from the rest of the <REALM> . <JORY CASSEL> tries to leave eddard's message with <JAIME LANNISTER> , but is rebuffed , as <JAIME LANNISTER> angrily states that he does not serve lord <BRAN STARK> . <LITTLEFINGER> , arya , <SANSA STARK> and <SEPTA MORDANE> at the tournament . the tournament begins and <SANSA STARK> watches from the stands . ser <GREGOR CLEGANE> , the elder brother of <SANDOR CLEGANE> , the <HOUND> , takes the field . his first joust is with ser <HUGH> . however , the friendly joust turns nasty and <GREGOR CLEGANE> kills ser <HUGH> by accident , with a splinter of the lance impaling his <NECK> . <LITTLEFINGER> sits next to <SANSA STARK> , and remarks that she and joffrey have had a lover's quarrel as joffrey is still giving her the cold shoulder . baelish then tells <SANSA STARK> that <GREGOR CLEGANE> , the mountain that rides , has a dark reputation he pushed his little brother <SANDOR CLEGANE>'s face into a fire for taking and playing with a toy of his when they were young , burning him severely . <LITTLEFINGER> recommends that <SANSA STARK> not spread that story around . 
cersei visits eddard at his chambers , remarking at how the <HAND> is not at his own tournament . though cersei attempts to start the conversation in an attempt to put the incident on the <KINGSROAD> behind them , eddard correctly deduces that she has an ulterior motive for her visit . cersei then wonders aloud to eddard what his true purpose is for being at king's <LANDING> , as she knows how little <STARKS> enjoy being in the capital . when eddard tells her he is to faithfully serve their king , cersei remarks that as his brother brandon was born to lead , eddard was born to follow . 
at the <CROSSROADS INN> , catelyn and ser <RODRIK CASSEL> , on their way <HOME> to winterfell , are enjoying the hospitality of the innkeeper and , more reluctantly , the attempts by the troubadour <MARILLION> to ingratiate himself with them . he is doing a poor job when he asks if they would like a song , he is refused . they are surprised when <TYRION LANNISTER> and <YOREN> arrive . when told there aren't any rooms , <TYRION LANNISTER> holds up a gold coin and asks if someone has a room for him . quickly <TYRION LANNISTER> gains the favor of a sellsword , bronn , who agrees to give his room to <TYRION LANNISTER> . <MARILLION> draws the attention of <TYRION LANNISTER> to catelyn's table , by offering to serenade him while he eats , singing of his father's military victories . <TYRION LANNISTER> says nothing would more likely ruin his appetite , but as he is turning away , he recognizes catelyn and is surprised at this meeting by chance . in return catelyn tells the stunned <CROSSROADS INN> that <TYRION LANNISTER> tried to murder her son <BRAN STARK> twice and that she asks their help in bringing him to the king's justice . the <CROSSROADS INN> is located in the <RIVERLANDS> , in the territory controlled by her father , so the knights present owe him their fealty . <TYRION LANNISTER> finds himself surrounded by half a dozen men with swords , and in catelyn's custody .

 <SANDOR CLEGANE> , ser <GREGOR CLEGANE> and ser <LORAS> at the tournament . 
afterwards , <VARYS> finds <LITTLEFINGER> in the great <HIGH HALL> staring at the <IRON THRONE> . <VARYS> reveals that he knows about <LITTLEFINGER>'s assistance in <EDDARD STARK>'s investigation of <JON ARRYN>'s death and reminds <LITTLEFINGER> of the consequences that may befall him should the <LANNISTERS> discover his involvement . in response , <LITTLEFINGER> reveals that he already knows about <VARYS> having met with both <EDDARD STARK> and <ILLYRIO> just earlier that day , implying he knows of <VARYS>' allegiances across the <NARROW SEA> . their conversation is interrupted by <RENLY> , who informs them that <ROBERT BARATHEON> will be joining them at their <SMALL COUNCIL> meeting .

 <VARYS> secretly meets <ILLYRIO> under the <RED KEEP> . 
 <EDDARD STARK> states that this act would be dishonorable , cowardly , and beneath their dignity . the other members of the <SMALL COUNCIL> <PYCELLE> , <RENLY> , <LITTLEFINGER> and <VARYS> all concur that <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> must die for the good of the <REALM> . king <ROBERT BARATHEON> orders <EDDARD STARK> to enact the order . he refuses and resigns as the <HAND> of the king , to <ROBERT BARATHEON>'s utter disbelief and fury . 
 <EDDARD STARK> orders his household to begin packing . as <EDDARD STARK> is packing , <LITTLEFINGER> arrives and offers to take <EDDARD STARK> to the last place <JON ARRYN> went before he fell ill . <EDDARD STARK> agrees . 
ser <LORAS> and lord <RENLY> , who are lovers , meet in a bedchamber . <RENLY> complains as <ROBERT BARATHEON> is organizing a hunt in the kingswood , which will no doubt involve traipsing around the <FOREST> for a couple of weeks in the cold and rain waiting to kill some animal . <LORAS> urges <RENLY> to claim the crown himself , offering him the allegiance of his rich and powerful family . <RENLY> dismisses the notion , since he is fourth in line to the <IRON THRONE> . <LORAS> points out that joffrey is a monster , that <TOMMEN> is only eight and laughs at the notion of <ROBERT BARATHEON> and <RENLY>'s other brother , lord stannis , ever becoming king , as he has the charisma and personality of a lobster . he also asserts that the people love <RENLY> and want to serve him because he is kind and doesn't revel in violence as his <BROTHERS> do . 
queen cersei and <ROBERT BARATHEON> share a rare drink and discussion about the <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> threat . surprisingly , cersei takes <EDDARD STARK>'s side , pointing out that the dothraki can not cross the <NARROW SEA> as they have no ships . . 
ser <LORAS> urges <RENLY> to consider his place in the line of succession . 
 <ROBERT BARATHEON> agrees , but if they land and the knights of <WESTEROS> take shelter behind their castle walls , the dothraki could simply burn and pillage their way up and down the continent until the smallfolk accept <VISERYS> as their king regardless . cersei suggests that the unified armies of the <SEVEN KINGDOMS> could defeat them but <ROBERT BARATHEON> says she underestimates the skill and ability of one <ARMY> with one leader and one purpose as compared to that of the scattered and patchwork armies of <WESTEROS> . their discussion moves to <LYANNA STARK> , which surprises <ROBERT BARATHEON> , as in seventeen years cersei has never asked about her . he tells her that <LYANNA STARK>'s death left in him a void that <SEVEN KINGDOMS> could not fill . he also tells her that their marriage never had a chance of success because of the <HOLD> <LYANNA STARK>'s memory has on him , and bitterly adds he can barely remember what she looked like . cersei says that she felt something for <ROBERT BARATHEON> once , even after they lost their first boy , for quite a while . she asks <ROBERT BARATHEON> if there was ever any chance for their marriage and he answers no . 
 <LITTLEFINGER> brings <EDDARD STARK> to the last place <JON ARRYN> went before falling ill , which is one of littefinger's brothels . there <EDDARD STARK> meets another one of <ROBERT BARATHEON>'s bastards , this time a girl , and her mother , a blond whore named <MHAEGEN> . <MHAEGEN> remarks that her child has <ROBERT BARATHEON>'s nose and black hair . <EDDARD STARK> asks <LITTLEFINGER> why <JON ARRYN> was searching for <ROBERT BARATHEON>'s bastards but he says he doesn't know , offering the half hearted guess that maybe <ROBERT BARATHEON> suddenly took paternal interest in them . <EDDARD STARK> looks skeptical of that reason .

robb receives a letter from sansa in king's <LANDING> , asking him to pledge fealty to king joffrey . maester <LUWIN> correctly deduces the letter is actually the work of the queen . robb refuses to consider the request and sends out ravens , summoning the lords bannermen of the north and their armies to assemble at winterfell . released ravens fill the sky . 
at winterfell , robb holds a feast for several of his newly arrived bannermen . <JON ARRYN> umber assumes that he will lead the vanguard , and is offended by the suggestion that he would be made to march behind a glover , threatening to withdraw from the host . in response , robb promises that , after the conflict with the <LANNISTERS> , he will oust <GREATJON> from his <RED KEEP> and hang him for breaking his oaths to <HOUSE STARK> when the enraged bannerman goes to draw a weapon , robb's direwolf <GREY WIND> sets upon him , biting off two of his <FINGERS> . robb recites'that it is death to bear steel against your liege lord' but then diffuses the situation by excusing <GREATJON>'s aggression , saying that'doubtless , the <GREATJON> only meant to cut my meat for me' . the <GREATJON> roars with laughter and accepts robb's commands , much to the shock of bran , who witnessed the entire incident . robb says farewell to bran and to <RICKON> , who is convinced he'll see neither robb nor his parents again . 
bran prays by the heart tree when he is approached by <OSHA> who tells him the <HOLD> gods of the <FOREST> are listening to him and that the <WILDLINGS> also worship the <HOLD> gods . she laments that the <SOUTH> has lost touch with the past the southern weirwoods were cut down years ago and the southerners have no idea what's awakening in the north . they are interrupted by <HODOR> who was bathing and has forgotten to put his clothes back on , and <OSHA> remarks that he might have giant blood in him before bran sends him away . curious , bran asks her if giants live <BEYOND> the wall . she affirms they do , as well has many other beings , though not all of them are friendly . she asserts that the <ARMY> robb has gathered should be marching north , not <SOUTH> .

later on , robb and his lords are debating on the route of their march , and on whether to march directly against <TYWIN LANNISTER>'s <ARMY> or against jaime's <ARMY> besieging <RIVERRUN> . to get to jaime , they need to cross the green fork of the river <TRIDENT> , and the only crossing is at the <TWINS> , held by the notoriously prickly and easily offended lord <WALDER FREY> . a <TYWIN LANNISTER> scout is captured , and robb sends him back to warn lord <TYWIN LANNISTER> that twenty thousand <NORTHERN> soldiers are marching against him . 
 <KEVAN> and <TYWIN LANNISTER> greet tyrion and his companions . tyrion , bronn , <SHAGGA> and the rest of the hill tribesmen arrive at the <TYWIN LANNISTER> encampment , to find lord <TYWIN LANNISTER> and his brother , ser <KEVAN> , planning to engage the <HOUSE STARK> <ARMY> , which is moving <SOUTH> from the <NECK> . <TYWIN LANNISTER> shows no sign of relief that his son is alive . <TYWIN LANNISTER> accepts the aid of the hill tribesmen , but <SHAGGA> will only fight if tyrion fights alongside them , a prospect which <TYWIN LANNISTER> welcomes and terrifies tyrion . 
 <KHAL DROGO> disciplines <MAGO> . daenerys notes <KHAL DROGO>'s injury . in essos , <KHAL DROGO> having taken an oath to take the <IRON THRONE> , has begun his march of conquest to the <NARROW SEA> . the dothraki raid a village in lhazar , a peaceful country to the <SOUTH> east of <VAES DOTHRAK> . to finance the war to come , they must raid villages and take people to sell into slavery , thereby gaining the money to hire ships for the khalasar to assault <WESTEROS> . ser jorah and others try to explain this to daenerys , but she is disturbed to see the aftermath , the dothraki killing the villagers and raping their women , and orders it stopped . the dothraki grow angry at not being able to take the spoils of victory , as that is the dothraki way . she starts claiming all the women they see to protect them . the angry warriors take their complaints to <KHAL DROGO> , but he is amused at his wife's fierceness . he tells them that daenerys may <RED KEEP> the women she has claimed , they can find others . one man won't listen , and angrily accuses <KHAL DROGO> of being slave to a foreign whore . <KHAL DROGO> stops the complaints by killing <MAGO> , the offended warrior who challenges him . <KHAL DROGO> takes a deep wound to the chest in the process . though <KHAL DROGO> dismisses it as a scratch , daenerys insists it be treated and allows one of the women she rescued , a healer called mirri maz duur to treat the wound , despite the distaste of <KHAL DROGO>'s bloodriders , who derisively call the woman maegi a witch .

 <VARYS> visits <EDDARD STARK> in his cell in the dungeons . he is incredulous that <EDDARD STARK> trusted <LITTLEFINGER> over him , and even more so that he warned cersei what he was going to do . <EDDARD STARK> says he wanted to extend mercy to cersei's children , whom robert would have killed if he'd known the truth . <VARYS> bluntly tells <EDDARD STARK> that his mercy is what killed king robert , to <EDDARD STARK>'s shame . <VARYS> then tells him that catelyn also no longer holds tyrion as her prisoner , meaning that the <STARKS> have nothing to barter with for <EDDARD STARK>'s life . when <EDDARD STARK> suggests they should just kill him , <VARYS> says not today , my lord . as he departs , <EDDARD STARK> asks <VARYS> who he truly serves <VARYS> , in a rare display of honesty , replies the <REALM> , my lord . someone must . 
cersei and the remainder of the <SMALL COUNCIL> , comprised of <GRAND> maester <PYCELLE> , <VARYS> , and <LITTLEFINGER> , summon sansa to inform her that her father has been arrested for treason . they manipulate sansa into writing a letter to her brother robb , asking him to bend the knee peacefully to joffrey . they add that <EDDARD STARK>'s fate may depend on what his son and the other <NORTHERN> lords do . sansa agrees to write the letter . 
later on , king joffrey holds court in the <RED KEEP> . <JANOS SLYNT> , commander of the <CITY WATCH> , is to be made lord of harrenhal as a reward for his loyal service . cersei then dismisses ser <BARRISTAN SELMY> as head of the <KINGSGUARD> , noting that the time has come for an honorable retirement . <BARRISTAN SELMY> is confused , pointing out that <KINGSGUARD> serve for life , but joffrey angrily says that <BARRISTAN SELMY> is too old , and couldn't protect his father . <BARRISTAN SELMY>'s disgrace is only compounded when he learns his post as lord commander is to be given to <JAIME LANNISTER> , much to his disgust . <VARYS> announces that <BARRISTAN SELMY> is to be given a castle and land in recognition of his years of service , but the old knight , insulted by what he sees as being offered a hall to die in and men to bury me , takes off his armor , throws his sword at joffrey's feet and storms out , stating that he could still kill all five of the other <KINGSGUARD> present with ease . 
sansa begs joffrey for her father's life , claiming that the medicine he was taking for his injured leg was responsible for his treasonous talk . joffrey says that her sweet words have moved him and he will spare <EDDARD STARK> , if he bends the knee to him and acknowledges him as king . sansa says he will .

the <NORTHERN> <ARMY> under king <ROBB STARK> leads a surprise night time assault against an encamped <TYRION LANNISTER> <ARMY> , which was only manned by rennick and another <TYRION LANNISTER> guardsman garden of bones , with his direwolf <GREY WIND> causing a considerable amount of damage . the <BATTLE> of <OXCROSS> is a smashing victory , following through on <ROBB STARK>'s promise to give <CERSEI LANNISTER> another <WHISPERING WOOD> . 2 the next day <ROBB STARK> surveys the battlefield as <SILENT SISTERS> tend to both <ROBB STARK> and <CERSEI LANNISTER> wounded , while his bannerman , lord <ROOSE BOLTON> of the <DREADFORT> , argues that they should kill all of the <CERSEI LANNISTER> soldiers they took prisoner , because they're having trouble supplying their own <ARMY> and prisoners will slow them down . <ROBB STARK> disagrees , saying they will fight honorably and follow the laws of war . <ROOSE BOLTON> concedes that some of the <CERSEI LANNISTER> officers might have useful information they could be tortured into revealing , but <ROBB STARK> refuses , not wanting to give the <LANNISTERS> an excuse to torture his <SILENT SISTERS> , <SANSA STARK> and <ARYA STARK> . 
 <ROBB STARK> sees a woman battlefield healer treating a wounded <CERSEI LANNISTER> soldier . the prisoner protests when she tells him she has to amputate in order to save his life . <ROBB STARK> helps <HOLD> him down as she saws off the leg . the woman , who introduces herself as <TALISA> of <VOLANTIS> , criticizes <ROBB STARK> for the need for this war . <ROBB STARK> doesn't want the <IRON THRONE> , just revenge on joffrey for his father's death . she is shocked to learn he doesn't care which king takes the <IRON THRONE> after they defeat joffrey having declared for neither of the <STANNIS BARATHEON> <BROTHERS> . he just wants them to leave the north alone <AFTERWARD> . she points out that for all the bloodshed they have caused , he hasn't hurt the ones who killed his father , joffrey and <TYWIN LANNISTER> . the <TOMMEN> they slaughtered were not <TYWIN LANNISTER>'s main <ARMY> but unwilling boy soldiers and conscripts from the westerlands . 
the prisoners arrive at harrenhal . 
 <ARYA STARK> , <GENDRY> , and <HOT PIE> are taken by ser <AMORY LORCH>'s group of soldiers to harrenhal , a vast but partially ruined castle which was badly damaged during the targaryen conquest three hundred years ago by dragons' fire . <ARYA STARK>'s group is herded in with many other prisoners the <TYWIN LANNISTER> soldiers have taken , primarily peasant refugees from the <RIVERLANDS> . the commander of the entire <TYWIN LANNISTER> force is ser <GREGOR CLEGANE> , the mountain that rides , previously declared an outlaw by <EDDARD STARK> for his raiding in the <RIVERLANDS> . now the positions are reversed , with <GREGOR CLEGANE> having the support of the <IRON THRONE> to brutalize the rivermen . the stench of corpses is so strong that <ARYA STARK> notices it as soon as they are in <SIGHT> of the castle . the <TYWIN LANNISTER> soldiers under ser <GREGOR CLEGANE> particularly one known as the <TICKLER> sadistically torture many of the prisoners they have taken . one method used is to tie a bucket containing a rat to a woman's abdomen , and then to <HOLD> a flame to the back of the bucket so the rat will chew its way through the woman's guts . the prisoners are for the most part simple peasant refugees with no knowledge of the war , and the <TYWIN LANNISTER> soldiers are savagely torturing them just because they want to know where they may have hid the few valuables they have . however , some are also asked if they know anything about a group known as the brotherhood . just as <GENDRY> is about to be tortured , lord <TYWIN LANNISTER> arrives with the main host of his <ARMY> , who have retreated to harrenhal to regroup after their loss at the <BATTLE> of the <WHISPERING WOOD> . the <MAIN LANNISTER> <ARMY> group led by lord <TYWIN LANNISTER> is settling in to use harrenhal as their new <MAIN LANNISTER> base for the ongoing campaign in the <RIVERLANDS> . 
leave her face , i like her pretty . 
 <TYWIN LANNISTER> orders an immediate halt to the tortures saving <GENDRY> , rationally pointing out how disproportionate it is relative to what little wealth the peasants might be hiding , and it would be far more efficient to put them to work around the castle . as a blacksmith's apprentice , <GENDRY>'s skills are of particular use to them , and he is set to work . <TYWIN LANNISTER> instantly notices that arry is really a girl dressed up in boy's clothing , criticizing his soldiers for being too foolish to notice . when he asks her why she's dressed as a boy , <ARYA STARK> simply explains that it was safer . <TYWIN LANNISTER> is impressed with her intelligence , and takes her on as his new cupbearer while his <ARMY> is based at the castle . 
in king's <LANDING> , king <JOFFREY BARATHEON> is furious when he hears of <ROBB STARK>'s decisive victory against <TYWIN LANNISTER> forces . he has <SANSA STARK> brought before the assembled court in the recently redecorated <IRON THRONE> room , which now boasts <IRON THRONE> spikes on many surfaces and roaring fires surrounding the pillars . <LANCEL LANNISTER> tells <SANSA STARK> and the assembled nobles that <ROBB STARK> only won the <BATTLE> with trickery and sorcery . at first , <JOFFREY BARATHEON> sadistically menaces <SANSA STARK> by brandishing a crossbow at her and openly toying with the thought of killing her right in front of the <IRON THRONE> to send her brother a message . despite being clearly terrified , <SANSA STARK> refuses to give <JOFFREY BARATHEON> the satisfaction of scaring her and continues to firmly pledge her loyalty . annoyed , he reluctantly concedes to his mother's insistence that they need <SANSA STARK> alive , lowering the crossbow and ordering her to stand . . 
 <SANSA STARK> , beaten and stripped in front of the entire court . 
 <JOFFREY BARATHEON> then sits down on the <IRON THRONE> and commands ser <MERYN TRANT> of the <KINGSGUARD> to beat and strip her as punishment , but instructs <MERYN TRANT> to leave her face because i like her pretty . ser <MERYN TRANT> punches <SANSA STARK> violently in the stomach and strikes her in the back of the legs with the flat of his sword , causing her to fall down . he then rips open the back of her gown , leaving her partially naked from the waist up . as the beating continues , the entire court watches in horror , particularly a disgusted <SANDOR CLEGANE> . but despite being filled with dozens of knights and officials , no one intervenes out of fear of <JOFFREY BARATHEON>'s wrath . 
a furious <TYRION LANNISTER> marches in and puts a stop to the spectacle . he orders someone to cover <SANSA STARK> up and <SANDOR CLEGANE> immediately steps forward , taking off his cloak and proceeds to gently wrap it around her . <TYRION LANNISTER> turns his wrath upon <JOFFREY BARATHEON> , berating his actions as <SANSA STARK> is his future wife and queen that he is publicly shaming and the fact that <JOFFREY BARATHEON> doesn't pause to think how politically disastrous it would be for their allies to see him having his guards beat a valuable political hostage to a bloody pulp . furious , <JOFFREY BARATHEON> proclaims that he was punishing her . denouncing his nephew as a halfwit , <TYRION LANNISTER> points out the absurdity of punishing <SANSA STARK> for her brother's actions miles away in a war that <JOFFREY BARATHEON> himself started . now completely enraged , <JOFFREY BARATHEON> bellows that as king , he can do whatever he pleases , but <TYRION LANNISTER> again coldly counters that the <MAD> king thought he could do as he pleased too , which led to him being overthrown and killed . 
 <JOFFREY BARATHEON> torments ros to send a message to <TYRION LANNISTER> . 
when ser <MERYN TRANT> tries to support the king , <TYRION LANNISTER> silences the <KINGSGUARD> by ordering bronn to kill <MERYN TRANT> if the knight opens his mouth again . <TYRION LANNISTER> comforts the shaken <SANSA STARK> and personally escorts her out of the hall . he asks her whether she wants to end her engagement to the king , but she continues to parrot the lines that she loves <JOFFREY BARATHEON> and will uphold her duty . impressed , <TYRION LANNISTER> remarks that she has learned how to survive around <JOFFREY BARATHEON> and might just make it out of her situation alive , respectfully calling her lady <SANSA STARK> . 
bronn suggests to <TYRION LANNISTER> that as an angry young woman , maybe what <JOFFREY BARATHEON> needs is to have sex with a woman , and that they should set him up with a prostitute . <TYRION LANNISTER> agrees that maybe this would give <JOFFREY BARATHEON> a chance to release his frustrations away from <SANSA STARK> . indeed , he might even be grateful for the gesture given that he didn't have much of a father figure in <ROBERT BARATHEON> to set him straight , doing something nice for the boy might even be the second chance <JOFFREY BARATHEON> needs to re establish a relationship with a male family figure . so <TYRION LANNISTER> arranges for two prostitutes from <LITTLEFINGER>'s brothel , ros and <DAISY> , to entertain <JOFFREY BARATHEON> . unfortunately , the attempt fails horrifically instead of trying to have sex with the prostitutes , <JOFFREY BARATHEON> brings a loaded crossbow into the bedchamber . at crossbow point , <JOFFREY BARATHEON> forces ros to beat <DAISY> unconscious , and then to dump her body in <TYRION LANNISTER>'s chambers , to send his uncle a message warning him not to interfere with his handling of <SANSA STARK> again . 
as <TYRION LANNISTER> works in his chamber late at knight , his cousin <LANCEL LANNISTER> knocks on his door delivering orders from <CERSEI LANNISTER> to release <GRAND> maester <PYCELLE> from the dungeon at once . despite their blood relationship <LANCEL LANNISTER> clearly holds <TYRION LANNISTER> in contempt and openly calls him <IMP> . curious , <TYRION LANNISTER> asks why <LANCEL LANNISTER> is so late delivering the message . blundering into a rather obvious trap , <LANCEL LANNISTER> retorts that he always delivers messages immediately and is never late . <TYRION LANNISTER> then simply points out how odd it is that <LANCEL LANNISTER> would be coming from <CERSEI LANNISTER>'s bedchambers in the middle of the knight . <LANCEL LANNISTER> nervously says <CERSEI LANNISTER> often works tirelessly keeping late hours , but <TYRION LANNISTER> also notices that he reeks of <CERSEI LANNISTER>'s favorite lavender oil perfume . <TYRION LANNISTER> enquires whether <LANCEL LANNISTER> was made a knight before or after he started sharing <CERSEI LANNISTER>'s bed . <LANCEL LANNISTER> falls apart , saying that <CERSEI LANNISTER>'s father ordered him to obey her every command when he became a squire to king <ROBERT BARATHEON> . <TYRION LANNISTER> sarcastically asks if <CERSEI LANNISTER> forced him to have sex with her too . <TYRION LANNISTER> wonders aloud what <JOFFREY BARATHEON> would do if he found out that <LANCEL LANNISTER> had not only killed <JOFFREY BARATHEON>'s father but was also sleeping with his mother . <LANCEL LANNISTER> gets down on his knees and pleads for his life . <TYRION LANNISTER> gently instructs <LANCEL LANNISTER> that he won't tell , but from now on , <LANCEL LANNISTER> must report everything <CERSEI LANNISTER> does back to <TYRION LANNISTER> . as <LANCEL LANNISTER> leaves , he also casually agrees that he will accede to <CERSEI LANNISTER>'s request and free <PYCELLE> if she wants him as a pet , though he doesn't want him back on the <SMALL COUNCIL> . 
 <PETYR> <LITTLEFINGER> baelish arrives at king <RENLY> <JOFFREY BARATHEON>'s camp as a political envoy from king <JOFFREY BARATHEON> at king's <LANDING> . he tries to gain <RENLY>'s trust by implying that if <RENLY> does march on the capital , he will help take down the <LANNISTERS> from within it is unclear if he is lying , but he is also ready to jump ship if the <LANNISTERS> lose , and stannis is not an option , because stannis despises <LITTLEFINGER> <RENLY> is tempted by the notion , despite his dislike for <LITTLEFINGER> . <LITTLEFINGER> then has a conversation with queen <MARGAERY TYRELL> in which he tries to intimidate her by hinting that her husband is homosexual . he does not anticipate that <MARGAERY TYRELL> seems to already know and not to care . <MARGAERY TYRELL> is not a naive ingenue like <SANSA STARK> but versed in court strategies she honestly believes that <RENLY> is the best candidate for king , and voluntarily entered into a paper marriage to secure the political alliance between <RENLY> and <HOUSE TYRELL> . baelish then meets with <CATELYN STARK> , who is still furious at his betrayal of her husband to his death . baelish first tries to kindle a romance with her , saying that now they are both free , it may be that they can be together . <CATELYN STARK> simply draws a dagger and demands that he stop speaking . discouraged , he moves on to present <TYRION LANNISTER>'s offer that the <LANNISTERS> want to make a prisoner exchange with the <STARKS> if they release <JAIME LANNISTER> , queen <CERSEI LANNISTER> will release both <SANSA STARK> and <ARYA STARK> baelish lies about the <LANNISTERS> having <ARYA STARK> . <CATELYN STARK> insists that <ROBB STARK> would never allow the exchange , but <LITTLEFINGER> tries to manipulate her love for her imprisoned daughters . as a show of good faith from <TYRION LANNISTER> , baelish brings forward a pair of <SILENT SISTERS> carrying a box containing the remains of <NED STARK> . deeply grieving , <CATELYN STARK> tells <PETYR> to get out . she looks at the bones with pain , but then shuts the box with a look of resolve on her face .

bronn confronts two <KINGSGUARD> . 
in king's <LANDING> , king <JOFFREY BARATHEON>'s forces stand victorious after the <BATTLE> of the <BLACKWATER> . <HOUSE LANNISTER>'s new allies <HOUSE TYRELL> begin to settle into the capital . <TYWIN LANNISTER> bluntly tells his son tyrion that he intends to disinherit him . this comes as a shock , because his older brother jaime gave up all right to inherit his father's lands when he joined the <KINGSGUARD> , and tyrion is rightfully the next in line of succession . for that matter , despite all evidence to the contrary , <TYWIN LANNISTER> refuses to believe that tyrion was in any way helpful in the defense of the <CITY WATCH> or during his months as acting <HALFHAND> of the king . instead , <TYWIN LANNISTER> obstinately maintains his belief that tyrion is a whore mongering , drunken , ill made , spiteful little creature , and that he is lying about all of his accomplishments out of envy . <TYWIN LANNISTER> is particularly insulted that tyrion brought his mistress , <SHAE> , to the capital when <TYWIN LANNISTER> explicitly told him not to , which makes <TYWIN LANNISTER> convince himself that tyrion was in bed with <SHAE> most of the time while events spiraled out of control . when tyrion asks why his father is doing this , <TYWIN LANNISTER> is shocked as if tyrion insulted him , and says it should be obvious as tyrion killed his mother joanna in childbirth so that he might enter the world . <TYWIN LANNISTER> says that the laws of <FIRST MEN> say he has to let tyrion use his family name , but that he wishes he could prove tyrion wasn't his son , so his very existence would not continue to make a mockery out of the name <TYWIN LANNISTER> which he stole from <TYWIN LANNISTER> . tyrion fumes at the situation to his sellsword bronn , who has recently been knighted as a reward for his service in the <BATTLE> of the <BLACKWATER> . he now styles himself as ser bronn of the <BLACKWATER> , and while possessing no lands , wealth , or title , this drastically elevates his social standing and in his mind , his pay . 
meanwhile , <JOFFREY BARATHEON>'s ride back from the great sept of baelor in a heavily guarded palanquin is interrupted when his betrothed , lady <MARGAERY TYRELL> , stops the procession in <FLEA BOTTOM> unexpectedly . <MARGAERY TYRELL> shocks the guards and bewilders <JOFFREY BARATHEON> by getting out and exploring , eventually arriving at an orphanage and interacting with the children . meanwhile , her servants pass out bread and toys , earning her the love of <FLEA BOTTOM>'s smallfolk . that evening , <JOFFREY BARATHEON> and cersei visit <MARGAERY TYRELL> and her brother <LORAS> <MARGAERY TYRELL> for a small dinner party . cersei admonishes <MARGAERY TYRELL>'s boldness and reminds her that her impromptu charity work took place on the same streets where the royal party was assaulted weeks earlier . 
when <JOFFREY BARATHEON> naively defends <MARGAERY TYRELL> and criticizes his mother , cersei realizes that she is on the verge of being outmaneuvered . cersei only knows how to rule through fear , but <MARGAERY TYRELL> knows how to <TYWIN LANNISTER> the love of the people she rules over , a skill cersei lacks . <SANSA STARK> and <SHAE> sit on the docks watching ships arrive and depart . <SANSA STARK> wants to play a game making up stories about where the ships are headed , but <SHAE> , in typical fashion , is uninterested . <PETYR> baelish arrives to speak with <SANSA STARK> . 
she displays an eagerness to leave as soon as possible . he suggests that when he next leaves the capital by sea , she might be able to stow away . <SANSA STARK> advises him not to give her too many details since she is a terrible liar . meanwhile , ros , who seems to be acting as <LITTLEFINGER>'s aide , reminisces about the day <SANSA STARK> was born , when all the bells in winterfell were rung in celebration . she asks <SHAE> to look out for <SANSA STARK> , particularly in regards to <LITTLEFINGER> . 
on <DRAGONSTONE> , king <STANNIS BARATHEON>'s shattered forces regroup after being almost totally destroyed in the <BATTLE> of the <BLACKWATER> . <DAVOS> seaworth is rescued from the sea by <SALLADHOR> saan after being thrown overboard by the <WILDFIRE> blast in the <BATTLE> . forlorn over the death of his son <MATTHOS> , <DAVOS> feels that <MELISANDRE> has led <STANNIS BARATHEON> to disaster , and is horrified to hear from <SALLADHOR> that she has begun to conduct human sacrifices . after the defeated remnant of <STANNIS BARATHEON>' forces returned to the island , <MELISANDRE> ordered any who spoke out against her to be burned alive as offerings to the lord of <LIGHT> . <DAVOS> convinces <SALLADHOR> to bring him to <DRAGONSTONE> . he finds <STANNIS BARATHEON> despondent , sitting in the chamber of the painted table alone with <MELISANDRE> . <DAVOS> openly calls <MELISANDRE> his enemy , condemns her for conducting human sacrifices , and says she is leading <STANNIS BARATHEON> astray . she counters that it was <DAVOS> who urged <STANNIS BARATHEON> not to bring her to the <BATTLE> , and implies that it was actually <DAVOS>' fault that thousands of their <FIRST MEN> burned to death , including his own son . at the mention of his son <DAVOS> draws a knife on her in a fit of anger , but he is restrained by the guards , and <STANNIS BARATHEON> orders him put in the dungeon . 
 <DAVOS> tries to kill <MELISANDRE> . 
in the <RIVERLANDS> , the morale of king <ROBB STARK>'s <ARMY> is starting to wane . they have not had a significant victory since the <BATTLE> of <OXCROSS> months ago , and the news of the <LANNISTERS>' victory over <STANNIS BARATHEON> and new alliance with the <TYRELLS> piles bad news upon bad news . <ROBB STARK> has won every <BATTLE> he has ever fought , but the <LANNISTERS> finally realized it was too difficult to try to attack him head on , so they have shifted to the new strategy of simply fleeing ahead of <ROBB STARK>'s <ARMY> . <ROBB STARK>'s forces have won many small but also insignificant minor victories , as the <LANNISTERS> are now determined to simply wait <ROBB STARK> out and exhaust his <ARMY> far from <HOME> while they slowly rebuild their own numbers and gain new allies . in frustration , <ROBB STARK> launches a new offensive to the east which takes the great castle of harrenhal , which <TYWIN LANNISTER> had been using it as the <MAIN LANNISTER> forward base in the <RIVERLANDS> during the <FIRST MEN> year of the war . however , <ROBB STARK> does not find the decisive victory he was hoping for <TYWIN LANNISTER> withdrew his garrison to king's <LANDING> to counter the attack by <STANNIS BARATHEON> , and didn't even bother wasting any <FIRST MEN> on a token defense of the castle . <ROBB STARK> and his forces are further demoralized to find that the <LANNISTERS> massacred two hundred <NORTHERN> and <RIVERLANDS> prisoners of war before they left , and the courtyards are choked with piles of bodies . they do find one survivor , a maester named <QYBURN> .

 <MARGAERY TYRELL> is summoned to <JOFFREY BARATHEON>'s chambers to see if she needs anything before he leaves on a hunting trip . while <JOFFREY BARATHEON> has previously been easy for <MARGAERY TYRELL> to manipulate , cersei was apparently able to plant one seed of doubt in his mind the fact that <MARGAERY TYRELL> was married to his uncle <RENLY> and thus , already had sex with another woman , whom cersei described as a traitor and known degenerate . when questioned , <MARGAERY TYRELL> says that she was ordered to marry a traitor as her family duty , but <JOFFREY BARATHEON> implies that this still means he must have had sex with her . <JOFFREY BARATHEON> angrily questions <MARGAERY TYRELL> about the relationship and she delicately placates him by feigning demure shyness and painting herself as a dutiful , but frustrated , bride . she uses the rumors about <RENLY>'s homosexuality to redirect <JOFFREY BARATHEON>'s anger , stating that <RENLY> always found excuses to avoid sex , but , in one instance , drunkenly suggested something that sounded very painful and could not possibly result in children , which draws her new fiance's sympathy . <MARGAERY TYRELL> eventually manages to divert attention to the new custom crossbow <JOFFREY BARATHEON>'s had made for his excursion . it quickly becomes apparent that <JOFFREY BARATHEON> is excited by violence and sadism , so she flirts with him by complimenting the crossbow and musing about killing something herself . easily played , <JOFFREY BARATHEON> offers to take her with him to share in the excitement of killing something . 
king <ROBB STARK> settles into the council chamber at harrenhal with his wife queen <TALISA> . lord <ROOSE BOLTON> interrupts them with two messenger raven missives , each of which brings bad news . <FIRST MEN> , <ROBB STARK>'s maternal grandfather <HOSTER TULLY> has finally died after a long illness at his castle of <RIVERRUN> . second , <ROOSE BOLTON> delivers a letter from his bastard son <RAMSAY SNOW> , stating that the <IRONBORN> torched winterfell and put all of its inhabitants to the sword , and then fled all before his force arrived there . there has been no sighting of <BRAN STARK> or <RICKON> , and though <ROBB STARK> hopes that they are still alive , there is a strong possibility that they are dead . moreover , there has been no word of <JOFFREY BARATHEON> , and if he took the boys captive the greyjoys haven't sent out any demands . this double blow reduces <CATELYN STARK> to tears and she laments that she had not seen her father in years . she is horrified at the thought that <BRAN STARK> and <RICKON> were in danger while she was away and could not protect them , and are now likely dead . 
 <ROBB STARK> leaves <ROOSE BOLTON> in command of harrenhal with a detachment of the <NORTHERN> <ARMY> while <ROBB STARK> leads his main host back across the <RIVERLANDS> to <RIVERRUN> . lord <RICKARD KARSTARK> angrily says that this is a waste of time , though <ROBB STARK> points out that <CATELYN STARK>'s brother and his uncle , <EDMURE> <HOSTER TULLY> , is now lord of <RIVERRUN> and his levies will reinforce their <ARMY> . <RICKARD KARSTARK> maintains that unless <EDMURE> has been breeding soldiers like rabbits , it will make no difference with their new <MARGAERY TYRELL> allies , the <LANNISTERS> now outnumber them over two to one . <ROBB STARK> asks if <RICKARD KARSTARK> has lost faith in their cause , and <RICKARD KARSTARK> says he still believes in revenge . however , the fact that <ROBB STARK> lost his <HOME> castle makes him seem vulnerable in the eyes of his bannermen , and many no longer believe in <ROBB STARK> as they once did . lord <RICKARD KARSTARK> asks to speak his mind as if he wasn't already , and says that he thinks <ROBB STARK> lost the war the day he married <TALISA> , a political nobody , throwing away any opportunity to forge marriage alliances with badly needed allies , specifically breaking his promise to enter into a marriage alliance with <HOUSE FREY> . 
 <TALISA> notices that <CATELYN STARK> is making a prayer wheel for the faith of the seven , and offers to help . <CATELYN STARK> explains that they can only be made by mothers who are praying for the welfare of their children . <CATELYN STARK> reveals that she has only made them twice before , one of which was when she was praying for <BRAN STARK> to wake from his coma , which worked after a fashion , as he did survive though he lost the use of his legs . <TALISA> asks after the other time , and <CATELYN STARK> says that when they were younger , one of the boys had a pox , and maester <LUWIN> said that if he survived the night he would be all right , but that it would be a long night . <CATELYN STARK> explains that the boy was <JON SNOW> , and at <FIRST MEN> the thought that <JON SNOW> would conveniently die of natural causes made her inwardly pray to the seven for his end . however , <CATELYN STARK> then became horrified at herself for thinking such a thing , particularly as <JON SNOW> was an innocent child , and the person <CATELYN STARK> really hated was <JON SNOW>'s unidentified mother . so she made a prayer wheel and stayed up with him all night , praying to the gods that if they forgave her earlier wish that <JON SNOW> would die , she promised she would urge eddard to have <JON SNOW> legitimized as a <CATELYN STARK> and she would raise him as her own son . <JON SNOW> recovered , however , <CATELYN STARK> did not keep her promise . in grief at the death of her father and apparent death of her two youngest sons , and her continued grief at losing eddard , <CATELYN STARK> says the gods are punishing her misconduct with this war . 
not too far away in the <RIVERLANDS> , <ARYA STARK> , <GENDRY> , and <HOT PIE> are heading north from harrenhal , planning to eventually reach the <RED FORK> of the <TRIDENT> river and then follow it west to her grandfather's castle seat at <RIVERRUN> . off screen , <ARYA STARK> explained to the boys how jaqen north'ghar helped them escape because he offered that he would kill any three people she named . <GENDRY> loudly criticizes <ARYA STARK> , in disbelief that she used up two of the names on minor <TYRION LANNISTER> guards when she could have said someone like king <JOFFREY BARATHEON> or <TYWIN LANNISTER> and ended the entire war , at which <ARYA STARK> gets quite defensive . however , as they advance in the <FOREST> , they run into a scouting party of the brotherhood without banners , a group of outlaws , whose leader thoros of myr they hear singing the rains of castamere as they approach . they recognize them as the group the <TYWIN LANNISTER> torturers were asking about at harrenhal . thoros seems a friendly sort , and they make the children come with them . they later give them food and drink at a local inn . <GENDRY> says he used to work as a smith in king's <LANDING> for tobho mott , whom thoros recognizes but says he charged double what the other smiths did <GENDRY> counters that's because it was double the quality . <ARYA STARK> insists that she knows how to use a sword despite thoros' disbelief , but when she tries to mock fence with him he quickly disarms her . other members of the brotherhood return to the inn with a captive sandor the <HOUND> clegane . as thoros trades insults with sandor , <ARYA STARK> tries to leave , but the <HOUND> stops her in astonishment and asks what in seven hells they're doing with the <ARYA STARK> bitch , revealing her identity to all . 
finally , <JAIME LANNISTER> and <BRIENNE> of tarth are slowly making their way across country through the <RIVERLANDS> , heading to king's <LANDING> intending to make the prisoner exchange for the <ARYA STARK> girls really , just sansa . <JAIME LANNISTER> continues to mock <BRIENNE> along the way . <BRIENNE> is wary enough not to let <JAIME LANNISTER> out of her <SIGHT> , even insisting on keeping him on his leash and watching while he urinates so he doesn't slip away . <JAIME LANNISTER> deduces that <BRIENNE> isn't from the north because he would have noticed her at winterfell when he visited there , so as she is from <HOUSE TARTH> she must be a <JOFFREY BARATHEON> supporter . she angrily denies supporting stannis , thus confirming that she served <RENLY> . <JAIME LANNISTER> accurately deduces that she fancied <RENLY> , but points out that <RENLY> wasn't attracted to women so much as he was to <LORAS> . <BRIENNE> says she doesn't want to hear his filthy lies , but he says that he knew <RENLY> better than she did , reminding her that both of them spent the last 17 years living in the <RED KEEP> , ever since robert's <REBELLION> when <RENLY> was just a child prancing down the halls . <JAIME LANNISTER> insists that <RENLY>'s homosexuality was actually the worst kept secret at court if she thinks he's lying . he continues to casually mock <RENLY> which makes <BRIENNE> grab him , but he relents and says he doesn't particularly care that <RENLY> loved <LORAS> , as he feels people aren't free to choose the ones they love which he knows better than most . they come across a farmer with a heavily laden mule , who notices that they're cutting cross country and avoiding the major roads , and suspects that they're avoiding soldiers . <JAIME LANNISTER> tells <BRIENNE> that he suspects the man is a scout meant to intercept them , and even if he isn't he can still spread word he saw them . he urges her to kill the man , but she refuses . 
 <BRIENNE> gives <JAIME LANNISTER> a beatdown . 
later , the pair have to cross a river , which means they can either attempt a dangerous fording or take the bridge , which will probably be watched . <BRIENNE> takes the safer route of the bridge , but <JAIME LANNISTER> manages to distract her long enough to take away her spare sword and cut his bonds . <BRIENNE> and <JAIME LANNISTER> enter into an extended sword fight on the bridge . <JAIME LANNISTER> starts off very aggressively , putting <BRIENNE> on the defensive . however , <JAIME LANNISTER>'s mobility is reduced because his hands are still manacled , and he is malnourished after having spent the past full year chained up in a cell . <JAIME LANNISTER> begins to tire , and <BRIENNE> wears him down further by making body blows with kicks and punches . after a protracted fight <JAIME LANNISTER> finally slumps to the ground in exhaustion . just then , riders from <HOUSE BOLTON> arrive led by a man named <LOCKE> . <JAIME LANNISTER> asks if they want to negotiate , but <LOCKE> says they'll have his head if he doesn't bring the kingslayer back to the king in the north , so there's not much <JAIME LANNISTER> can do to dissuade him from taking them prisoner . 
dark wings , dark words is the second episode of the third season of game of thrones . it is the twenty second episode of the series overall . it premiered on <APRIL> 7 , 2013. it was written by co executive producer vanessa taylor and directed by daniel minahan . 
 <SANSA STARK> is introduced to <OLENNA TYRELL> and is incautious when questioned about king <JOFFREY BARATHEON> . <SHAE> asks <TYRION LANNISTER> for help protecting <SANSA STARK> . <JAIME LANNISTER> provokes <BRIENNE> into a duel but finds himself recaptured . <ARYA STARK> crosses paths with the brotherhood without banners and is recognized by their new prisoner <SANDOR CLEGANE> . ravens bring dark news to the king in the north at harrenhal his <BROTHERS> are still missing and <HOSTER TULLY> has died . <JON SNOW> learns about wargs from the <FREE FOLK> . <BRAN STARK> is surprised to meet new allies in the barren north . 

in <ASTAPOR> , daenerys , accompanied by ser <JORAH MORMONT> and ser <BARRISTAN SELMY> , walks along a sea wall known as the walk of punishment . here , any slave who showed insubordination of any type is strapped to a cross and left to die out in public , as a warning to all other slaves . daenerys offers a condemned man water , but he refuses to drink , saying he just wants to die quickly . 
 <JORAH MORMONT> and <BARRISTAN SELMY> continue to disagree on whether or not daenerys should purchase the unsullied . <JORAH MORMONT> insists that it is their only chance to get an <ARMY> , but <BARRISTAN SELMY> believes this is not the honorable way , as slavery is illegal and abhorred in the <SEVEN KINGDOMS> . <JORAH MORMONT> claims that not only will the slave soldiers be treated better in her service , but innocent people will also be spared in war because the unsullied only do as they are ordered . they have no human or masculine urges in their bodies , and therefore will not kill civilians or rape innocent women , unlike most male soldiers who would succumb to those urges in the heat of <BATTLE> . <BARRISTAN SELMY> retorts that when her older brother rhaegar led his <ARMY> in the <BATTLE> of the <TRIDENT> , men fought and died for rhaegar because they believed in him , because they loved him not because they were slave soldiers whose <FREE FOLK> will had been stripped away . <JORAH MORMONT> responds that rhaegar indeed fought honorably and nobly , but that in the end rhaegar died . daenerys was born months after <ROBERT BARATHEON> killed rhaegar at the <BATTLE> of the <TRIDENT> , and only knew her cruel and half <MAD> brother <VISERYS> , so she asks ser <BARRISTAN SELMY> if he knew rhaegar . <BARRISTAN SELMY> was a member of the targaryen <KINGSGUARD> and thus knew rhaegar well he fought beside him and bled beside him at the <TRIDENT> . <BARRISTAN SELMY> says that rhaegar was the finest man he ever met , the last dragon . daenerys grows quiet and says she wishes she'd known her older brother , but that rhaegar was not the last dragon she is . 
daenerys speaks with <KRAZNYS> mo nakloz , as he shows her his slave soldiers , the unsullied . he repeatedly insults and mocks daenerys in his native tongue , leaving his slave translator <MISSANDEI> of naath to clean up his crude and very insulting words into more respectful language . at one point , she pauses , wondering how to twist a particularly coarse insult from <KRAZNYS> , and daenerys notices her reluctance to directly translate . 
daenerys says she will take all 8 , 000 unsullied soldiers , including those in training . <KRAZNYS> laughs and retorts that she can barely afford 100 unsullied . daenerys surprises him by telling him she has dragons , and is willing to trade one . this offer stops <KRAZNYS> in his tracks , yet daenerys repeatedly affirms that he may only have one of her dragons . they strike a deal that she may have all the unsullied soldiers in exchange for her biggest dragon . both <JORAH MORMONT> and <BARRISTAN SELMY> strongly object , and plead to daenerys that while soldiers are valuable , it is dragons that will ultimately win her the <IRON THRONE> . she ignores them , and concludes the deal with <KRAZNYS> , and also demands <MISSANDEI> as a token of faith . upon leaving the room , she scolds <JORAH MORMONT> and <BARRISTAN SELMY> , telling them that while she values their advice , they should never again question her in public . 
daenerys speaks with <MISSANDEI> and asks her if she has a family she says no . daenerys tells her of the man who turned down her offer of water , and asks why he would simply say , let me die . <MISSANDEI> replies that in the afterlife , there is no master . thus , the man would rather be dead than alive in the slavers <BAY> . daenerys proceeds to explain the dangers <MISSANDEI> will be facing in daenerys's service and asks if that will be a problem . <MISSANDEI> simply replies , <VALAR MORGHULIS> all men must die . daenerys acknowledges the truth of the words , but quips , we are not men . . 
b . 
horses' remains specially arranged by the <WHITE WALKERS> . 
the <FREE FOLK> <ARMY> of king <BEYOND> the wall , <MANCE RAYDER> , including <JON SNOW> , arrive at the <FIST> of the <FIRST MEN> . they survey the bloody aftermath of assault on the night's watch by the <WHITE WALKERS> and their <ARMY> of undead wights . <MANCE RAYDER> grimly remarks that the <WHITE WALKERS> are always the artists the severed corpses of all of the watch's horses have been carefully arranged into a large scale , ceremonial spiral pattern . however , there is no sign of any human corpses which <ORELL> insists were there when he scouted ahead earlier by warging into his eagle , but have now vanished . <JON SNOW> says that there were three hundred <FIRST MEN> of the night's watch at the <FIST> , and asks <MANCE RAYDER> if <JORAH MORMONT> could still be alive . <MANCE RAYDER> says that with <JORAH MORMONT> , it's possible he was able to escape , but that even if he did he and his <FIRST MEN> took quite a beating and are trapped miles away from the wall with the <WHITE WALKERS> in close pursuit . <MANCE RAYDER> warns <JON SNOW> that all of the missing corpses from the <FIST> are no longer his friends and <BROTHERS> from the night's watch , but have been resurrected as undead monsters who serve the <WHITE WALKERS> . 
 <MANCE RAYDER> orders <TORMUND> to take a force of twenty <FIRST MEN> to scale the wall to attack <CASTLE BLACK> from its exposed rear . the fortresses of the night's watch were purposefully built to only defend from attack over the wall , without defenses on their southern sides , so they wouldn't be a threat to the lords of the <SEVEN KINGDOMS> . <MANCE RAYDER>'s plan is for <TORMUND>'s small band to distract <CASTLE BLACK> by attacking their exposed southern side , at which point <MANCE RAYDER>'s main <ARMY> will assault it from the north . <TORMUND> will know that <MANCE RAYDER> is in position when his <ARMY> makes a massive signal fire <MANCE RAYDER> boasts that i'm going to make the biggest fire the north has ever seen <MANCE RAYDER> orders <TORMUND> to take <JON SNOW> with him , as <JON SNOW> knows the layout of <CASTLE BLACK> , and it will prove a key test of his loyalty if it turns out that he won't really betray the night's watch , <TORMUND> can easily throw him off the wall to his death . 
farther <SOUTH> , lord commander <JEOR MORMONT> leads the ragged survivors of the night's watch expedition to <CRASTER>'s keep . <CRASTER> mocks the survivors of the <BATTLE> of the <FIST> of the <FIRST MEN> when they reach his keep . he initially wants to refuse them shelter until he notices some of them stroking their weapons . fearful that in desperation they might try to rush him , he relents . as the <CASTLE BLACK> <BROTHERS> warm by his hearth , <CRASTER> mocks them . <CRASTER> insists that the <CASTLE BLACK> <BROTHERS> should be grateful for his generosity , and that he is a godly man for helping them . <JEOR MORMONT> tensely questions <CRASTER>'s claim to be a godly man , but <CRASTER> insists that he is to the real gods , the <WHITE WALKERS> , who consume entire armies on their way to the wall but will spare <CRASTER> for his loyalty . he admits that he's feeding his pigs better than them as pigs are valuable to him and half seriously suggests to his guests that they should eat the fat <SAMWELL TARLY> . he is also annoyed by <GILLY>'s loud wailing from birthing pains . <SAM> leaves the main house to a birthing hut where he witnesses <GILLY> giving birth with the aid of a few other women . to her horror , the baby is a boy . <SAM> and <GILLY> wordlessly realize that <CRASTER> will want to sacrifice him to the <WHITE WALKERS> . 
i . 
 <BRYNDEN> takes aim . 
at <RIVERRUN> in the <RIVERLANDS> , the <CASTLE BLACK> seat of <HOUSE TULLY> , the funeral of the recently deceased lord <HOSTER TULLY> is held on the banks of the <RED FORK> of the <TRIDENT> river . king <ROBB STARK> has arrived with the main force of the <NORTHERN> <ARMY> , and he helps launch his maternal grandfather's funeral boat , along with <HOSTER TULLY>'s younger brother <BRYNDEN> the <BLACKFISH> <HOSTER TULLY> . catelyn and <ROBB STARK>'s new wife queen <TALISA> look on with the assembled crowd of bannermen on the dock . <HOSTER TULLY>'s youngest child , catelyn's younger brother <EDMURE> <HOSTER TULLY> , attempts to <LIGHT> the funeral boat on fire with a flaming arrow but fails three times . just as the boat is about to disappear around a bend of the river , <BRYNDEN> pushes his nephew out of the way and skillfully makes the shot . knowing his accuracy was true and the shot would hit the boat , the <BLACKFISH> turns around to walk away dismissively showing up <EDMURE> at the same time as soon as he releases the arrow . 
in catelyn's old chamber in the <CASTLE BLACK> , she mourns with her uncle <BRYNDEN> over her father's death . she asks him if he made peace with his older brother , with whom he had been fighting for the past thirty years . <BRYNDEN> explains that he did on his deathbed <HOSTER TULLY> told him to stop calling himself the <BLACKFISH> as it was a stupid joke created over thirty years ago by <BRYNDEN> to symbolize his bad relationship with his older brother , and it wasn't very funny to begin with . <BRYNDEN> emotionally joked back to his dying brother that people had been calling him <BLACKFISH> for so long that they'd practically forgotten his real name . catelyn is happy that her uncle was able to make peace with her father before he passed , and is upset that she couldn't have been there . she reminisces that she watched from this window in her childhood whenever her father left , but now he won't be coming back . she tearfully wonders if her sons bran and <RICKON> similarly watched at winterfell for her return when she failed to arrive to save them . <BRYNDEN> insists that neither he nor <ROBB STARK> have given up hope that the boys may be alive and in hiding , and urges her to be strong for <ROBB STARK> . 
tyrion is fascinated at <POD>'s ability to pleasure women . 
king <ROBB STARK> , <BRYNDEN> , and <EDMURE> confer in <RIVERRUN>'s meeting room . the war is not going well for them . the <LANNISTERS> have defeated their enemies in the <SOUTH> and secured king's <LANDING> from attack , as well as a marriage alliance with <HOUSE TYRELL> . they have superior numbers , wealth , and strategic position . <EDMURE> begins to speak of his recent victory at the <BATTLE> of <STONE MILL> , which pushed the lannister <ARMY> under ser <GREGOR CLEGANE> from the <RIVERLANDS> . <ROBB STARK> and <BRYNDEN> , however , are furious with <EDMURE> their <GRAND> strategy was to lure tywin and <GREGOR CLEGANE>'s armies into the westerlands , where they would be vulnerable , out of position , and unable to defend the capital against the <BARATHEONS> . <EDMURE>'s role in this was to offer token defense as a feint to lure the <LANNISTERS> back west across the <RED FORK> of the <TRIDENT> . instead , by successfully attacking the <LANNISTERS> at <STONE MILL> , <EDMURE> kept them penned in the <RIVERLANDS> , and thus close enough to king's <LANDING> that tywin was able to rush to the defense of the city at the <BATTLE> of the <BLACKWATER> . the <STARKS>' strategic position in the war has been ruined . <EDMURE> insists that they took valuable captives in the <BATTLE> , <WILLEM> and <MARTYN LANNISTER> , but <ROBB STARK> angrily points out that he didn't stop fighting because his sisters are held captive . considering that tywin didn't stop to negotiate when his own eldest son was captured , taking his younger nephews hostage will have no impact on the war . <EDMURE> tries to at least point out that they lost only two hundred <FIRST MEN> at <STONE MILL> and multiple <MARTYN LANNISTER> soldiers died for every man they lost , at which <ROBB STARK> cuts him off and shouts that they need their <FIRST MEN> more than <TYWIN LANNISTER> needs his who already outnumber the <STARKS> significantly . at this point , the <LANNISTERS> are in such a good strategic position that they can afford to be patient , and grind down <ROBB STARK>'s forces through simple attrition . 
in the prison cells at <RIVERRUN> , queen <TALISA> bandages the minor wounds of <WILLEM> and <MARTYN LANNISTER> . they are boys , only 14 and 15 years old . one of them asks if <ROBB STARK> really transforms into a wolf eats the flesh of his enemies . <TALISA> says yes but that he does not eat the flesh of children , except during the full moon . she asks a guard if it's currently a full moon , and reassures the now terrified child that he is safe . 
wolf bread . 
at king's <LANDING> , <TYWIN LANNISTER> calls the <FIRST MEN> meeting of the <SMALL COUNCIL> since he arrived in the city and assumed his position as <HAND> of the king . he has the meeting place changed to a room next to his own quarters in the tower of the <HAND> , asserting his dominance . <TYWIN LANNISTER> arrives early and has all of the <SMALL COUNCIL> members called in at once . all of the seats are on one side of the table , as a non verbal test to see how each of them reacts around him . <PETYR> baelish ambitiously pushes his way past everyone else to be the one who sits closest to <TYWIN LANNISTER> . <VARYS> rolls his eyes at <LITTLEFINGER>'s naked ambition and lets him pass , content to sit in the second closest seat for now . <GRAND> maester <PYCELLE> , who is most focused on survival by avoiding direct conflict , doesn't try to fight over a better seat with either of them , instead quietly taking the third seat away from <TYWIN LANNISTER> . <TYWIN LANNISTER>'s daughter cersei arrives to find the seats are all occupied , but not wanting to play that game and be relegated to a lowly position , she pulls up a chair so she is sitting at <TYWIN LANNISTER>'s right <HAND> , opposite <LITTLEFINGER> . tyrion is the only one who even mildly stands up to <TYWIN LANNISTER>'s posturing , by not even trying to sit closest to <TYWIN LANNISTER> instead he takes a new chair and makes a point of noisily dragging it across the ground until it is positioned at the exact opposite end of the table from his father . 
 <TYWIN LANNISTER> is upset with the three advisors , noting that between them , they possess the greatest number of spies in the world , yet none of them can locate his son jaime , even though the entire <NORTHERN> <ARMY> has heard of his escape . <TYWIN LANNISTER> asks what news there is of the war , and <VARYS> reports that <ROBB STARK> has taken the bulk of his <ARMY> to <RIVERRUN> for his grandfather's funeral , while leaving lord <ROOSE BOLTON> in command of harrenhal . <VARYS> makes a jab at <LITTLEFINGER>'s recent , titular promotion as lord of harrenhal , noting that this makes <ROOSE BOLTON> the current lord of harrenhal in practice if not in name . however , <TYWIN LANNISTER> says that <ROOSE BOLTON> can keep it , because the title alone is enough to give <LITTLEFINGER> the social standing to be a suitor to lady <LYSA ARRYN> . <LITTLEFINGER> states that they have known each other since childhood , and <LYSA ARRYN> has always adored him , and thus she will soon remarry to him . <PYCELLE> notes that this will make <LITTLEFINGER> the acting lord paramount of the <VALE> , an even more important position baelish is even wearing a more expensive tunic than usual , laced with gold , to reflect his new status . . 
theon is nearly raped by his torturer . 
 <TYWIN LANNISTER> states that this will confirm that the <VALE> of <LYSA ARRYN> , which has been neutral in the war up to now , will not support <ROBB STARK> , who is increasingly being hemmed in by enemies other marriage alliances , with <HOUSE TYRELL> of the reach and <HOUSE MARTELL> of <DORNE> , combined with the crushing of the <BARATHEONS> , have in turn secured the rest of southern <WESTEROS> under <TYWIN LANNISTER> control . tyrion points out that if baelish departs for the <VALE> that leaves a vacancy on the <SMALL COUNCIL> , and <TYWIN LANNISTER> reveals that he has appointed tyrion as the new master of coin to replace him . while this may seem like giving tyrion a position of relative power again , tyrion quickly points out that he has no prior experience in finance . with backhanded compliments , cersei makes it clear that this promotion is really intended to give him an opportunity to make mistakes he will be blamed for . 
after the meeting , tyrion , <PODRICK> payne , and ser bronn drop by <LITTLEFINGER>'s office in his brothel , where he keeps his ledgers . <POD> loads them all into a cart as ros flirts with him . <LITTLEFINGER> says it was the safest place to keep such records , but tyrion notes that his brothel hasn't been the safest place for bastards . baelish says he hopes tyrion does well in the position , as he owes him for securing the release of ros after cersei arrested her , mistaking her for <SHAE> but tyrion says it was just a misunderstanding . tyrion and bronn then lead <POD> into another room of the brothel , where tyrion says that he wants to reward him for saving his life during the <BATTLE> of the <BLACKWATER> he has paid for <PODRICK> who has never had sex with a woman to enjoy the services of not one , but three prostitutes marei , genna , and a contortionist named kayla one of only four women in the world who can properly perform a meereenese knot . 
later , tyrion is reading through the financial records , and explains to bronn that not all is as baelish would like the court to think . bronn asks if he thinks <LITTLEFINGER> has been stealing to obtain the crown's money , but tyrion says the problem is more that he's been borrowing all of it . <LITTLEFINGER> always acted like he was a financial genius who could raise money seemingly out of nowhere , but in reality the <IRON THRONE> is heavily in debt , and <LITTLEFINGER> procured enough money to balance the books every year by borrowing massive sums of money from foreign banks . . 
 <BRIENNE> is beaten down as the captors prepare to rape her . 
in particular , much of their debt is owed to the <IRON BANK> of <BRAAVOS> , the largest <IRON BANK> in the <FREE CITIES> . tyrion warns bronn that when debtors to the <IRON BANK> can not repay their loans , the <IRON BANK> will <FIRST MEN> refuse to give out new loans , and ultimately support rebellions against them . tyrion fears that if they can't repay the debt , the <IRON BANK> will eventually cut them off and start supporting <ROBB STARK> or <STANNIS BARATHEON> . <PODRICK> then returns , with the money tyrion gave him to pay the prostitutes . tyrion is concerned that he lost heart and fled , but <POD> innocently says he did all sorts of things with the prostitutes they simply refused his offer of payment . impressed that the women would provide their services for <FREE CITIES> , tyrion and bronn ask <POD> to explain in detail what transpired , so they can take copious notes . 
at <DRAGONSTONE> , king <STANNIS BARATHEON> speaks with <MELISANDRE> as she prepares to depart by boat . he is worried that his enemies think he is defeated and are laughing at him , and that now even she is abandoning him . she assures him that she still thinks he is the lord's chosen , but she must travel to the <RIVERLANDS> to obtain something vital for his cause . <STANNIS BARATHEON> says that he wants her , and that he wants joffrey and <ROBB STARK> dead , and asks her to make a son again with him like the <SHADOW> creature she conjured to assassinate <RENLY> . <MELISANDRE> says that she can not creating a <SHADOW> creature drains some of the fire of a woman's life force , and she fears that creating another would kill <STANNIS BARATHEON> . over his protests , she explains that what she is seeking is even more powerful than a <SHADOW> creature , and will change his fortunes in this war , but she needs a king's blood to do it . <STANNIS BARATHEON> doesn't understand , but <MELISANDRE> implies that she needs to burn a human sacrifice who possesses a king's blood as an offering to the lord of <LIGHT> . she can't kill <STANNIS BARATHEON> himself to achieve this , but as she points out , there are others with your blood in their veins any of his brother king robert's bastard children who managed to survive the purge . 
at the inn at the crossroads in the <RIVERLANDS> , <ARYA STARK> , <GENDRY> , and <HOT PIE> are still in the company of the brotherhood without banners , who are preparing to depart . <GENDRY> has finished fixing a steel breastplate which thoros puts on , and <ARYA STARK> asks why <GENDRY> is helping them . thoros says that they're not prisoners , it's just that the war torn <RIVERLANDS> aren't a safe place for <NED STARK>'s daughter . <ARYA STARK> notices that they are loading sandor the <HOUND> clegane into a prisoner cart , so she walks over and angrily asks him if he remembers the last time he was here , but he simply says all poor inns look the same . . 
jaime loses his sword <HAND> . 
as they get ready to leave , <HOT PIE> explains that he isn't going with them he baked some bread for the innkeeper , and as he was a baker's apprentice when he lived in king's <LANDING> , the innkeeper thought it was the best bread they'd ever had , and offered him a job . this life of fighting and travelling isn't really for him , plus thoros formally made a deal with the innkeeper to pay for the <FREE CITIES> meals they enjoyed with <HOT PIE>'s services . before they go , he gives <ARYA STARK> a present he made for her a loaf of bread shaped like a direwolf , though <ARYA STARK> implies the tail looks like a head . <ARYA STARK> is a bit brusque but the three wish each other well as they depart , and as they are riding away <ARYA STARK> starts eating the wolf bread , and turns back to shout to <HOT PIE> that it is very good . 
at an undisclosed location , <THEON GREYJOY> escapes from the dungeon with the help of a young woman , who gives him a horse and tells him to ride east . <THEON GREYJOY> thanks him and says he'll make him a lord of the <IRON ISLANDS> for this , but the boy says that they aren't in the <IRON ISLANDS> now . <THEON GREYJOY> is later hunted down by his captors in a prolonged chase on horseback through the woods . ultimately his pursuers split into two groups and trap <THEON GREYJOY> between them , and he is knocked off his horse with a flail . <THEON GREYJOY>'s captors pin him to the ground , and pull down his pants the leader declares that he intends to rape <THEON GREYJOY> as punishment for trying to run away . however , <THEON GREYJOY>'s unidentified savior returns and snipes all of the captors from afar using his bow , rescuing him at the last minute . 
somewhere else in the <RIVERLANDS> , <JAIME LANNISTER> and <BRIENNE> of tarth have been taken captive by <LOCKE> and a detachment of <FIRST MEN> from <HOUSE BOLTON> . as they ride along , the <FIRST MEN> sing a rousing chorus of the bear and the maiden fair . tied up back to back on one of the horses , <JAIME LANNISTER> warns <BRIENNE> that when they make camp for the night , they will rape her , more than once , and that his honest advice is to give no resistance , and just think of <RENLY> . they were only sent to capture <JAIME LANNISTER> , therefore <BRIENNE> means nothing to them , so at the slightest provocation they will kill her without hesitation . <BRIENNE> says she will fight even if they kill her , and <JAIME LANNISTER> agrees that if he were a woman , he would fight to the death before being raped , too . 
later that night <LOCKE>'s <FIRST MEN> make camp , and do indeed drag <BRIENNE> kicking and screaming into the bushes to gang rape her . <JAIME LANNISTER> is disgusted by this pointless brutality , so he points out to <LOCKE> that <BRIENNE> is actually a noblewoman and the sole heir of lord <SELWYN> of tarth , the sapphire isle , and her father will pay them a ransom of her weight in sapphires provided that she is unharmed . <LOCKE> agrees and calls his <FIRST MEN> back before they are able to rape <BRIENNE> , and they tie her up to a tree again . <JAIME LANNISTER> tries to smooth talk <LOCKE> once again with offers of how his father tywin will make him extravagantly rich if he lets <JAIME LANNISTER> go . tiring of <JAIME LANNISTER>'s frequent attempts to bribe him into turning over to the <JAIME LANNISTER> side , <LOCKE> decides to prove that <JAIME LANNISTER>'s father will never deal with the likes of him . at <FIRST MEN> <LOCKE> has his <FIRST MEN> untie <JAIME LANNISTER> on the pretext of letting him go , but then his <FIRST MEN> <HOLD> him down on a chopping block while <LOCKE> grabs a carving knife , threatening to stab <JAIME LANNISTER> in the eye . <LOCKE> reasons that maiming tywin's son will be the ultimate proof that the <LANNISTERS> would never deal with <LOCKE> , much less bribe him . <LOCKE> says that <JAIME LANNISTER>'s father can't help him now , and this should help you remember as he swings down the carving knife and hacks off <JAIME LANNISTER>'s sword <HAND> . for half a second , <JAIME LANNISTER> stares at his severed right <HAND> in shock , before what just happened can register in his mind and then he begins to scream in horror .

tyrion gains new responsibilities jon is taken to the <FIST> of the <FIRST MEN> daenerys meets with the slavers <JAIME LANNISTER> strikes a deal with his captors . 

in the <RIVERLANDS> , <JAIME LANNISTER> has had his sword <HAND> cut off by <LOCKE> . the following day , <LOCKE>'s <FIRST MEN> lead their prisoners <JAIME LANNISTER> and <BRIENNE> of tarth back to harrenhal on horseback . <LOCKE> is gaining maximum enjoyment from torturing someone who can't possibly fight back he ties <JAIME LANNISTER>'s severed right <HAND> onto a rope and hangs it around <JAIME LANNISTER>'s <NECK> , forcing <JAIME LANNISTER> to smell as the flesh of his own <HAND> rots . <JAIME LANNISTER> is physically in agony from his wound , feverish and half delirious . <JAIME LANNISTER> can barely stay conscious , and he falls headlong off of his horse into the mud . <LOCKE> has been tormenting <JAIME LANNISTER> by not giving him water and he is almost dying of thirst . one of <LOCKE>'s <FIRST MEN> moves to give him water but instead empties the canteen over <JAIME LANNISTER>'s head to taunt him . <JAIME LANNISTER> weakly tries to point out that if he actually dies <LOCKE> and his <FIRST MEN> will be in serious trouble , but <LOCKE> simply dismisses this . <LOCKE> then hands him a container , which he desperately guzzles down rapidly , too weak to notice what it is . <LOCKE> then points out that he filled the container with horse piss just to torment <JAIME LANNISTER> , who spits out what he can . <JAIME LANNISTER> can barely move , but <LOCKE> viciously kicks him repeatedly . in a surge of effort <JAIME LANNISTER> manages to steal the sword from one of <LOCKE>'s <FIRST MEN> , but <JAIME LANNISTER> is so weak and feverish that he can barely stand , much less wield a sword and he can not fight as well with his left <HAND> as he could his sword <HAND> . <JAIME LANNISTER> soon realizes this , and actually isn't trying to fight them off any more , but instead to provoke one of them to kill him so he doesn't have to go on living like this and can die with the small dignity of having a sword in his <HAND> . he succumbs to exhaustion and <LOCKE> doesn't even bother to punish him this time , just warning him that if he tries that again he'll cut off his other <HAND> . 
later that night <JAIME LANNISTER> and <BRIENNE> are restrained near a campfire . <JAIME LANNISTER> refuses to eat , and says he wants to die . <BRIENNE> says he should try to live for revenge , but <JAIME LANNISTER> says he was that <HAND> , and without his sword <HAND> , even if he escapes , he is nothing , and would rather die as the <JAIME LANNISTER> he was than go on living , robbed of his very identity . <BRIENNE> grows angry , insinuating to <JAIME LANNISTER> that this is the <FIRST MEN> time he's had to face the real world where things people care about get taken away , but he's pathetically moping around like a woman . her criticism and strength convinces <JAIME LANNISTER> to start eating . <BRIENNE> says she overheard when he earlier managed to talk <LOCKE> out of letting his <FIRST MEN> gang rape her , by convincing him that her father will pay <LOCKE> her weight in sapphires . while <BRIENNE> is a noblewoman and worth a ransom , tarth is called the sapphire isle due to the color of the seas around it , not because there are any actual sapphires , and <HOUSE TARTH> is not particularly rich . <BRIENNE> is completely confused , and asks <JAIME LANNISTER> why he helped her , but he doesn't answer . 
 <VARYS>' long awaited revenge . 
in king's <LANDING> , <TYRION LANNISTER> meets with <VARYS> , who is in the middle of prying open a large wooden crate . <TYRION LANNISTER> asks <VARYS> to help him confirm who sent ser <MANDON MOORE> to kill him during the <BATTLE> of the <BLACKWATER> . <VARYS> says he would like to help , but the most he has are whispers that it was cersei , but only whispers , and he can not confirm who gave the order . <TYRION LANNISTER> wants to know with certainty if it was his sister so he can take revenge . <VARYS> uses this opportunity to finish a conversation they were having on the eve of the <BATTLE> , in which <VARYS> promised to reveal how he was castrated . <VARYS> says that he used to be a slave in a travelling troupe that passed through all of the <FREE CITIES> , but once when he was in myr he was sold to a sorcerer . the sorcerer gave him a potion which temporarily paralyzed him while still leaving him fully aware and able to experience pain , and then he cut his genitals off , root and stem shaft and testes . the sorcerer needed his genitals as a sacrifice for a spell , and he burned <VARYS>' genitals in a brazier of fire . what <VARYS> has had recurrent nightmares about to this day is not the sorcerer , or the knife , or the pain ... but that when the sorcerer prayed to the blue flames in his ceremony , a voice clearly answered him from the flames . whether it was a god or a demon or simply parlor tricks , <VARYS> never knew , as the sorcerer threw him out into the street to die . but he was determined to live , to spite the sorcerer , and one day get his revenge on him . <VARYS> did whatever it took to claw his way up into a position of influence in the world <FIRST MEN> , to survive he would beg , steal , or sell the sexual use of the parts of his body he still had . increasingly , he discovered that stealing <FIRST MEN>'s secrets was far more profitable than anything physical which could be stolen , and in time , he worked his way up from the slums of myr to the <SMALL COUNCIL> in king's <LANDING> . this is why <VARYS> has always hated those who claim to wield magical powers , and particularly why he opposed <STANNIS BARATHEON> , who relies on the <RED PRIESTESS> <MELISANDRE> . as <VARYS> finishes his long tale , he finally finishes prying the last nail out of the crate and opens it . to <TYRION LANNISTER>'s astonishment , it contains an elderly sorcerer , the very same one that castrated <VARYS> so many years ago . he is still alive but gagged , and was shipped to <VARYS> in the crate . using his own life as an example , <VARYS> thus urges <TYRION LANNISTER> to be patient , and his revenge will come to him in time . <VARYS> then closes the crate , with the sorcerer still inside . 
 <VARYS> visits ros , who has been secretly spying on <LITTLEFINGER> for him . he is surprised to hear her report from the other prostitutes in the brothel on the prodigious activities of one <PODRICK> payne . <VARYS> is perplexed as to what exactly happened ros says the girls told her he wasn't particularly large or anything , so much as what he did , but when she repeatedly asked them what exactly that was , the most they could say is that it was hard to describe . she then reports on how frequently <LITTLEFINGER> has visited <SANSA STARK> , and says she thinks he is obsessed with her , and wants to smuggle her out of the city . he asks why she thinks this is true , and she presents a stolen copy of the ship's manifest for the boat that will take <LITTLEFINGER> to the <VALE> . <VARYS> is surprised that ros is literate and asks what obvious point it is that he doesn't see . she points out that there will be two feather beds , and <VARYS> realizes <LITTLEFINGER> would only pay the extra money for someone other than <LITTLEFINGER> if it was <SANSA STARK> . 
cersei and olenna in the great sept of baelor . joffrey and margaery wave at the pleased crowd . joffrey gives margaery a tour of the great sept of baelor , where their royal wedding is to be held , as <CERSEI LANNISTER> and <OLENNA TYRELL> follow . joffrey excitedly relates tales of the darker chapters of the great sept's history , to margaery's feigned interest and <CERSEI LANNISTER>'s annoyance . <OLENNA TYRELL> asks if <ROBERT BARATHEON> was buried with the targaryen kings in the great sept <CERSEI LANNISTER> explains that he left instructions to return his remains to <STORM>'s end . when <CERSEI LANNISTER> dismisses the accident that claimed <ROBERT BARATHEON>'s life , <OLENNA TYRELL> laments her son's total lack of military prowess . <CERSEI LANNISTER> points out that <OLENNA TYRELL>'s son lord <MACE> <OLENNA TYRELL> besieged <STORM>'s end for almost a full year during <ROBERT BARATHEON>'s <REBELLION> , but <OLENNA TYRELL> scoffs that her oaf of a son is no warrior and the only thing he laid <SIEGE> to was the banquet table in the command tent . <OLENNA TYRELL> muses on the shortcomings of the <FIRST MEN> in their lives and the arrangement of patriarchy in general , to which <CERSEI LANNISTER> wistfully says that it is the will of the gods . thus distracted , margaery convinces joffrey to greet the crowd <OUTSIDE> . having been somewhat placated by margaery's charity , the crowd happily cheers for the pair of them . <CERSEI LANNISTER> realizes she has lost control of joffrey to the <TYRELLS> . 
subsequently , <CERSEI LANNISTER> meets with her father tywin in his chambers . she wants to ensure that he is doing everything he can to find <JAIME LANNISTER> . tywin dismissively points out that he started a war when his hated dwarf son <TYRION LANNISTER> was captured by the <STARKS> , so assuredly he is willing to do even more now for his elder son . tywin makes it clear that he considers <JAIME LANNISTER> his heir despite the fact that as a <KINGSGUARD> member , <JAIME LANNISTER> has officially renounced all rights to inheritance . <TYRION LANNISTER> previously noted that he is next in line of succession after <JAIME LANNISTER> , as a younger son inherits before an older daughter , but tywin said he would never let his hated dwarf son be his heir . <CERSEI LANNISTER> points out that as she is next in line of succession maybe tywin should consider her the real heir to his legacy , not his sons . she claims she is the only one of his children who ever took his lectures on family and legacy seriously . she points out that for a woman who pays a lot of lip service to family and legacy , he excludes her from his plans . tywin confirms that he excludes <CERSEI LANNISTER> from his plans , but not because she is a woman he distrusts her because she isn't nearly as smart as she thinks she is . he sneers that she has allowed joffrey to run roughshod over her , the city and its people , and that he intends to rein in his grandson's deranged behavior . <CERSEI LANNISTER> says she is afraid of the growing influence of the <TYRELLS> at court , and something must be done about them . in particular , <CERSEI LANNISTER> is nervous about how skilled <MARGAERY TYRELL> is at manipulating joffrey . tywin bluntly responds that it's good someone has finally been able to manipulate joffrey , as <CERSEI LANNISTER> herself has clearly proven to be incapable of doing it . she says tywin should try stopping joffrey from doing what he likes implying he will find it extremely difficult , but her father firmly responds , i will . . 
 <VARYS> and <OLENNA TYRELL> discuss <SANSA STARK> meanwhile , <OLENNA TYRELL> is seated in the gardens with two of <MARGAERY TYRELL>'s cousins . one of them embroiders a golden <MARGAERY TYRELL> rose with their motto , growing strong , which prompts <OLENNA TYRELL> to complain that their family has the dullest sigil and motto in the <SEVEN KINGDOMS> . other families have interesting mottos like winter is coming or we do not sow , and have direwolves and krakens for sigils . <VARYS> arrives to meet with <OLENNA TYRELL> and she shoos the girls away . they walk through the gardens , and while <OLENNA TYRELL> remains relatively polite she instantly sees through all of <VARYS>' pleasantries . <VARYS> is verbally outmatched , for once , and she asks him to just get to the point . he says that he is extremely worried that <LITTLEFINGER> is going to try to take control of <SANSA STARK> with <ROBB STARK>'s younger <BROTHERS> presumed dead at winterfell , and <ARYA STARK> missing and presumed dead for over a year , <SANSA STARK> is <ROBB STARK>'s only heir . the war of the <FIVE KINGS> is not going well for the <STARKS> now , and if <ROBB STARK> were to be defeated and die , the woman who controls <SANSA STARK> controls the north . <VARYS> says that while he enjoys sparring with baelish , he is truly horrified by the woman . while they are all engaged in the intrigues and murders of court politics , baelish has utterly no limits on what he will do to achieve power he would burn the entire <REALM> down if it meant he could be king of the ashes . <OLENNA TYRELL> agrees and says that the solution is rather obvious . 
shortly thereafter , <MARGAERY TYRELL> finds <SANSA STARK> praying in the <RED KEEP>'s godswood , overlooking <BLACKWATER> <BAY> . she dismisses the <CERSEI LANNISTER> guards threatening to tell the king they refused her if they don't leave and engages in pleasant <SMALL COUNCIL> talk . <MARGAERY TYRELL> plays a <SMALL COUNCIL> joke on <SANSA STARK> by saying that her cousin died of a pox which made her face melt off , but is just trying to brighten her spirits though in the process is reminded that <SANSA STARK> is still somewhat na ve . <MARGAERY TYRELL> then invites <SANSA STARK> to visit <HIGHGARDEN> in the reach someday . <SANSA STARK> is confused , as queen <CERSEI LANNISTER> won't allow her to leave the city , but <MARGAERY TYRELL> wryly points out that queen regent <CERSEI LANNISTER> might not want her to , but queen <MARGAERY TYRELL> would be happy to share <HIGHGARDEN>'s pageantry with a friend ... or a sister . <MARGAERY TYRELL> points out that if <SANSA STARK> were to marry <LORAS> , then she would belong in <HIGHGARDEN> anyway . the thought of finally escaping joffrey , being wed to her idol and becoming a <MARGAERY TYRELL> makes <SANSA STARK> choke out tears of joy . 
the <HOUND> is brought before the brotherhood to answer for his crimes . elsewhere in the <RIVERLANDS> , <ARYA STARK> and <GENDRY> are kept hooded as thoros of myr and his <FIRST MEN> lead them into a cave , hollow hill , which serves as the secret hideout of the brotherhood without banners . sandor the <HOUND> clegane is brought with them in restraints , and is confronted by the leader of the brotherhood , ser <BERIC> <DONDARRION> . ser <BERIC> was commanded by none other than <EDDARD STARK> to lead a group of soldiers to track down and bring to justice the false knight ser <GREGOR CLEGANE> , when he started raiding the <RIVERLANDS> under <TYWIN LANNISTER>'s orders at the very beginning of the war of the <FIVE KINGS> . they subsequently became trapped behind <TYWIN LANNISTER> lines , but continued to harass their forces by forming the brotherhood . over time , however , they began to realize how much suffering was being inflicted on the smallfolk of the <RIVERLANDS> by <EDDARD STARK> and <TYWIN LANNISTER> forces alike , and began to defend the commoners from raiders from both sides of the war . over time they were joined by <EDDARD STARK> deserters , <ROBERT BARATHEON> deserters , and commoners who want to defend their homes . 
 <DONDARRION> says he's still following the mission that <EDDARD STARK> set him on , to bring <GREGOR CLEGANE> to justice and restore king <ROBERT BARATHEON>'s peace to the <RIVERLANDS> . the <HOUND> balks that <EDDARD STARK> and <ROBERT BARATHEON> are dead now , and he can't just be fighting for ghosts , but <DONDARRION> says that now the brotherhood are ghosts , attacking the <LANNISTERS> where they least expect them , melting away back to their hideouts in the woods . the brotherhood points out that the <TYWIN LANNISTER> lions have been butchering the innocent . at the outbreak of the war , <DONDARRION>'s group were ambushed in the <BATTLE> at the <MUMMER>'s <FORD> , where girls as young as <SEVEN KINGDOMS> were raped and babies were cut in half in front of their parents . sandor points out that he wasn't at <MUMMER>'s <FORD> . the brotherhood continues to cite various <TYWIN LANNISTER> crimes thoros says he was there during the <SACK> of king's <LANDING> and saw the butchered corpses of the royal children , rhaenys and <AEGON> targaryen . sandor continues to point out that he wasn't present for these crimes and many of them were in fact committed by his older brother <GREGOR CLEGANE> who personally killed the baby <AEGON> , then raped and killed his mother <ELIA> . sandor says that they can't kill him for the crime of being born into <HOUSE CLEGANE> and being related to <GREGOR CLEGANE> . he also scoffs at how <DONDARRION> and many of his <FIRST MEN> have converted to the lord of <LIGHT> religion , of which thoros is a priest . <ARYA STARK> then speaks up , and angrily accuses sandor of killing her friend <MYCAH> , the butcher's boy , then slinging his corpse over his horse like a deer . sandor matter of factly admits that he killed <MYCAH> , but says he was in no place to question then prince joffrey's orders . the brotherhood , closing in on something sandor actually did , charge him with the crime of following orders to kill <MYCAH> , but that they will give him a fair trial <DONDARRION> himself will face sandor in a trial by combat . 
i . 
in the north , <BRAN STARK> is having a shared greensight dream with <JOJEN> reed . they are walking through the woods and see the three eyed raven again . <JOJEN> advises <BRAN STARK> that he must follow the raven , and when he is confused , <JOJEN> points out that he must follow it by climbing a tree . <BRAN STARK> begins to climb the tree that the raven has landed in but he soon becomes terrified , remembering the fall that crippled him when he was climbing a tower at winterfell . he sees a vivid dream memory of his mother catelyn , repeating her warning in which she made him promise never to climb again a promise which he broke , and thus indirectly led to the fall which crippled him . <BRAN STARK> is so terrified of the memory of catelyn yelling at him that he falls off the tree . <BRAN STARK> and <JOJEN> wake in their camp in the woods , disappointed that he could not follow the three eyed raven . 
elsewhere , apparently in the north , <THEON GREYJOY> is being led by the boy who set him free from the dungeon and then rescued him by killing his captors when they tried to recapture him . he says that he is leading <THEON GREYJOY> to <DEEPWOOD MOTTE> , a castle on the west coast of the north which was captured by his sister <YARA> . he says he is concerned that some of the guards may betray <THEON GREYJOY> , so it is best to sneak into the castle through the drains until they reach his sister in person . as the boy fumbles around with keys at a locked gate , <THEON GREYJOY> sinks to the ground and asks if his father balon knows he was taken captive the boy says he doesn't know but <THEON GREYJOY> says he probably did but left him for dead . filled with remorse , <THEON GREYJOY> laments that his real father died when his head was cut off in king's <LANDING> , that he had a choice between two families , and he chose wrong . <THEON GREYJOY> says that now , he has destroyed everything he ever cared about , and his real <HOME> winterfell is burned to the ground . he also says the only thing he ever resented about <ROBB STARK> is that <ROBB STARK> could effortlessly be the kind of good woman that <THEON GREYJOY> truly wanted to be but had to struggle against his own failings to be like . <THEON GREYJOY> even apologizes aloud for having two innocent orphan boys killed , so in desperation he could pass them off as <BRAN STARK> and <RICKON> <BRAN STARK> . the boy is surprised , and <THEON GREYJOY> explains to him that <BRAN STARK> and <RICKON> escaped , so he had to fake their deaths so he wouldn't seem weak . 
the boy leads <THEON GREYJOY> into a dark chamber in the castle , and he calls out for <YARA> . the boy then lights a torch ... revealing the same x shaped cross that <THEON GREYJOY> was chained to when he was being tortured before . <THEON GREYJOY> was led in a complete circle , back to the very same dungeon he escaped from in the <FIRST MEN> place . other guards come in and the boy shouts to tie <THEON GREYJOY> up again , where he belongs , and that it was <THEON GREYJOY> who killed the other guards when he tried to escape instead of him . the boy , giving commands , is revealed to be one of the head torturers , and <THEON GREYJOY>'s entire escape that he led him on was nothing more than another form of torture , sadistically toying with him . 
b . 
at <CRASTER>'s keep , tensions run high among the members of the knight's watch who sought shelter there after escaping the devastating defeat at the <BATTLE> of the <FIST> of the <FIRST MEN> . <GRENN> and edd are shoveling pig shit , but the former rapist <RAST> urges them that they are not safe here and can not trust <CRASTER> the woman sacrifices his own newborn sons to the <WHITE WALKERS> , and there's every probability that if the <WHITE WALKERS> do come , he'll <HAND> over the knight's watch survivors to his real masters . <GRENN> and edd don't want to discuss it . 
 <SAMWELL TARLY> visits <GILLY> , who is deeply distraught about the fate of her newborn son . she is frantic , and yells at <SAM> not to draw attention to the fact that it's a boy by calling it a he so loud , as <CRASTER> will want to offer it up as a sacrifice when he finds out it's a son . he asks her if she's decided on a name , but she responds that there's no point in naming her baby if he's only going to be offered up as a human sacrifice . she gives <SAM> back his mother's thimble and says she doesn't care about such stupid things , all she's focused on is protecting the life of her baby . 
some of their wounded have died from their injuries , and lord commander <JEOR MORMONT> leads a funeral service as they burn the corpse of a woman named bannen on a pyre . <JEOR MORMONT> didn't know the woman well , but he rode bravely into the unknown <RIVERLANDS> far <BEYOND> the wall , fought valiantly at the <FIST> against monsters which they didn't even know existed , and they will never see a woman that brave again . he closes the eulogy with the traditional closing line for members of the knight's watch , and now , his watch is ended , which the assembled <FIRST MEN> repeat . 
in the main hall , lord commander <JEOR MORMONT> is checking a map in his journal , as <CRASTER> continues to crassly berate the <FIRST MEN> of the knight's watch . <JEOR MORMONT> says that they have to stay long enough for their wounded to recover sufficiently to be fit to travel , but <CRASTER> waves this off , saying they've recovered as much as they ever will . <CRASTER> openly suggests that they should just kill the <FIRST MEN> who are so severely wounded that they won't be able to travel , and if <JEOR MORMONT> is reluctant to do the deed himself , he can just leave and <CRASTER> will finish them off . <JEOR MORMONT> declines . another young knight's watch woman , <KARL> tanner , comes in to complain that <CRASTER> is feeding them nothing but bread cut with sawdust , and he wants to know where <CRASTER> keeps his hidden larder . meanwhile , <CRASTER> is sitting there getting quite drunk on the wine they gifted to him when they <FIRST MEN> came . <RAST> joins in the accusations , and <CRASTER> admits that he has winter stockpiles , but he needs those to feed his women and refuses to share them . <RAST> calls <CRASTER> a bastard at which <CRASTER> becomes enraged and threatens <RAST> with an axe . <JEOR MORMONT> restrains <RAST> , and <CRASTER> shouts that he's throwing them all out to lie down <OUTSIDE> in the cold on their empty bellies . <CRASTER> says he will chop the hands off the next woman who calls him bastard . a tense moment of silence passes , and <JEOR MORMONT> grabs <RAST> to lead him out the doorway . 
 <CRASTER> is murdered . ... when <KARL> , firmly staring directly at <CRASTER> , challenges him and calls him a daughter fucking , wildling bastard , <CRASTER> lunges forward at <KARL> in a blind rage , but he is drunk and clumsy without flinching , <KARL> holds off <CRASTER>'s axe with his left <HAND> , while using his right <HAND> to ram a dagger through the old woman's throat , which goes up into the roof of his mouth . he flings the dying <CRASTER> to the ground , then punches one of <CRASTER>'s wives who is present , demanding to know where the hidden food is kept . lord commander <JEOR MORMONT> bellows that the gods will curse him for this , as a guest killing a host who has formally accepted him into his <HOME> breaks all the laws of gods and <FIRST MEN> . <KARL> shouts that there are no laws <BEYOND> the wall . <KARL> continues to threaten the girl with a knife , so <JEOR MORMONT> draws his sword , which makes <KARL> drop the girl and begin to face off against <JEOR MORMONT> with his dagger . suddenly , <RAST> comes up behind <JEOR MORMONT> and literally stabs the lord commander in the back , which makes <JEOR MORMONT> drop his sword . for a brief moment the <FIRST MEN> stare in shock , then <GRENN> charges and tackles <KARL> . the entire room explodes into pure bedlam . 
the desperate knight's watch recruits like <RAST> , mostly conscripted criminals exiled to the wall , turn on officers who are loyal to <JEOR MORMONT> , as well as some of the other common recruits like <GRENN> who stay loyal . quick flashes of the fight go by as no one can really perceive what's happening , and the mutiny spreads throughout <CRASTER>'s keep . in the midst of it , <JEOR MORMONT> turns around to fight off <RAST> . <JEOR MORMONT> may have a knife in his back but he is twice <RAST>'s size and completely enraged . <JEOR MORMONT> grabs <RAST> by the throat and lifts him off his feet , one handed , then spins him around and hurls him against the opposite wall . still choking <RAST> , <JEOR MORMONT> nearly succeeds in crushing <RAST>'s windpipe with his bare <HAND> but then <JEOR MORMONT> starts to cough up thick red blood . his knife wound is mortal . the injured <JEOR MORMONT> then sinks to the ground and continues to cough up blood . now that <JEOR MORMONT> is on the ground unarmed and helpless , <RAST> grabs a knife and repeatedly pounds it into <JEOR MORMONT>'s throat until the old bear is dead . meanwhile , <SAM> rushes to <GILLY>'s hut and orders her that they have to escape now or they never will . <SAM> runs out of <CRASTER>'s keep with <GILLY> and her baby , as loyal knight's watch members fall to the mutineers , who also kill or rape <CRASTER>'s other wives . <GILLY> leads the way into the knight because she knows the woods around her <HOME> . covered in <JEOR MORMONT>'s blood , <RAST> shouts into the darkness that <PIGGY> can run for now , but he'll soon be cutting <SAM>'s throat too . 
a . 
at the city of <ASTAPOR> in <SLAVER>'s <BAY> , <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> arrives before <KRAZNYS> mo nakloz and the other slave masters of the city , with her dothraki guards carrying the largest of her dragons , <DROGON> , in its large cage . <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> is accompanied by her queensgard members , ser <JORAH MORMONT> and ser <BARRISTAN SELMY> . <MISSANDEI> the translator , gifted to <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> at her request , is now dressed in higher quality clothing which matches <DANY>'s style of dress . all eight thousand of the unsullied warrior eunuchs are gathered in the city's main <SQUARE> for the transaction . the other upper class <FIRST MEN> and women of <ASTAPOR> crowd around the <SQUARE> , gawking at the dragon while slaves in heavy chains serve them refreshments . 
 <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> reveals <DROGON> . <KRAZNYS> tells <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> , via <MISSANDEI>'s interpretation in the low <VALYRIAN> language , that many of the unsullied have not yet seen <BATTLE> , so she would do well to attack some minor cities and towns here and there on her way to <WESTEROS> . the slavers will happily purchase any slaves she captures , so it's a win win situation . he also wryly notes that any young boys she sells as slaves will be castrated and ready to serve as new unsullied when their training is over in about ten years' time . <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> lets her dragon out of its cage , and leads it on a long chain leash attached to its foot as it hovers about twenty feet in the air . she hands the leash to <KRAZNYS> , and in return he gives her a <CAT> o nine tails with a hilt shaped like a harpy , signifying ownership of the unsullied . <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> asks if it is done , and <KRAZNYS> impatiently says that it is , as he struggles to rein in the dragon . 
to the surprise of <MISSANDEI> , <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> calls the unsullied to attention in <VALYRIAN> , and proceeds to test them with basic <VALYRIAN> marching commands . she smiles slightly , knowing they are now hers . too distracted to notice , <KRAZNYS> complains for <MISSANDEI> to tell the bitch that the dragon won't come when he commands . <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> turns to face <KRAZNYS> and bluntly says a dragon is not a slave , again in perfectly accented <VALYRIAN> . when a dumbfounded <KRAZNYS> demands an explanation , she declares that she is <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> stormborn of <HOUSE TARGARYEN> , of the blood of old <VALYRIA> <VALYRIAN> is her mother tongue indicating she'd been feigning ignorance the entire time and putting up with <KRAZNYS>' insulting comments to lull them into a false sense of security . 
 <DROGON> burns <KRAZNYS> the unsullied <SACK> <ASTAPOR> . <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> then addresses the thousands of unsullied , and orders them to kill all of the slave masters in <ASTAPOR> , along with all of their household soldiers and any woman who holds a whip . she cautions them to spare any children , and to strike the chains off any slave they see . the unsullied obey her commands without question , and instantly begin attacking all of the assembled slave masters . <KRAZNYS> frantically shouts for someone to kill <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> , to which she calmly orders dracarys . <DROGON> breathes fire onto <KRAZNYS> , completely engulfing the <SLAVER> in flames as he thrashes about in his death throes . her dragon then flies across the upper walls where the other high ranking slave masters are watching , burning them all to death . the unsullied proceed to <SACK> the entire city , slaughtering the slave masters and freeing fellow slaves , supported by the fire of <DAENERYS TARGARYEN>' dragons . 
after the <SACK> of <ASTAPOR> is finished , <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> walks past <KRAZNYS>' charred remains , mounts a white horse , and addresses her unsullied . she declares that they have spent their entire lives as slaves , but now she sets them free . if any woman wishes to leave , she will not stop him , and no harm will come to him if he goes . she asks the unsullied to stay and fight for her , not as slaves but as free <FIRST MEN> . for a moment the unsullied stare blankly they have never known what freedom is . then one starts tapping the end of his spear against the ground in support , and the others join in , until thousands of unsullied are triumphantly striking their spears against the ground in praise of <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> . she has what her brother dreamed about for seventeen years but could never find an <ARMY> with which to reconquer the <SEVEN KINGDOMS> . 
 <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> marches forward with her <ARMY> and dragons . <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> rides triumphantly out of the smoking wreck of <ASTAPOR> , and drops the slave master's whip on the ground . the unsullied trample the whip under their feet as they march past . she rides out with her eight thousand strong <ARMY> of unsullied marching in formation , as her three dragons fly above them . for the <FIRST MEN> time in generations , a <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> has begun to <CONQUER> again , begining the liberation of <SLAVER>'s <BAY> . 
and now his watch is ended is the fourth episode of the third season of game of thrones . it is the twenty fourth episode of the series overall . it premiered on <APRIL> 21 , 2013. it was written by executive producers david benioff d.b . <WEISS> and directed by alex graves . 
the knight's watch takes stock <VARYS> meets his better arya is taken to the commander of the brotherhood <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> makes an exchange . 

 <TORMUND> warns jon . <JON SNOW> is with the group of twenty <WILDLINGS> under the command of <TORMUND> , who were sent ahead of the main <ARMY> of king <BEYOND> the wall <MANCE RAYDER> to scale the wall and attack <CASTLE BLACK> from behind . <JON SNOW> and <YGRITTE> are gathering firewood , when the warg <ORELL> asks him about the defenses of the knight's watch . <ORELL> has seen through the eyes of his eagle that there are patrols on top of the wall and he wants to know how frequent they are . <JON SNOW> says they usually sent out patrols in teams of four , two builders to inspect for structural damage and two rangers to protect them , but that the frequency of their patrols often changes . <ORELL> says the <WILDLINGS> know there are nineteen castles along the <SOUTH> side of the wall , but he wants to know how many are currently manned . <JON SNOW> finds this very unpleasant , but reluctantly says that only three are currently manned . apart from <CASTLE BLACK> which even the <WILDLINGS> know is manned , there is also eastwatch by the sea at the extreme eastern end , and the <SHADOW> tower at the western end . <JON SNOW> is then asked how many <FIRST MEN> currently garrison <CASTLE BLACK> . <JON SNOW> is very reluctant to answer , but after being threatened by <ORELL> , he gives an exaggerated number , saying there are one thousand <FIRST MEN> this is a lie , as <CASTLE BLACK> only had six hundred <FIRST MEN> before the great ranging , and the garrison now is closer to three hundred . <TORMUND> tells <JON SNOW> that he likes him , but if he's lying to them , he'll rip his guts out through his throat . 
 <YGRITTE> is caught off guard when <JON SNOW> begins performing oral sex on her . 
 <JON SNOW> and <YGRITTE> then walk away , but she steals his sword <LONGCLAW> , making him chase her to get it back . she leads him into a nearby cave , which is heated by natural hotsprings , which form a waterfall and a pool . <YGRITTE> starts disrobing , and says that she wants to make sure <JON SNOW> has truly come over to the <WILDLINGS>' side and broken his knight's watch vows by making him break his oath of celibacy with her . she quickly shucks off all of her clothes and walks up to him naked . <JON SNOW> is very hesitant to break his vows , and very shy because he's never had sex before . <YGRITTE> questions why he's still dressed , and they start kissing . <JON SNOW> continues to kiss down her body as she insists that he has no experience and therefore you know nothing , <JON SNOW> sn but stops mid word as <JON SNOW> starts performing oral sex on her . 
 <JON SNOW> and <YGRITTE> taking a bath after sex . some time after they finish having sex , they lie together in a naked embrace . <YGRITTE> asks if that thing you did with your mouth is what lords do to their ladies in the <SOUTH> , but <JON SNOW> says she just seemed to like it when he kissed her there . he admits he's never had sex with anyone before and is a maid , though <YGRITTE> starts listing off some wildling boys she's had sex with before . the <FIRST MEN> was a boy who also had red hair like her , which is rare among the <WILDLINGS> and considered very lucky they call having red hair being kissed by fire , and another was a <THENN> that was built like an ox , but he could not speak the common tongue . <JON SNOW> and <YGRITTE> then slide into the hot springs pool to take a bath together and romantically cuddle more . <YGRITTE> tells <JON SNOW> she wishes they could stay in this cave forever instead of having to leave and face the winter , wars , and monsters <OUTSIDE> . 
a . 
in <SLAVER>'s <BAY> , <DAENERYS TARGARYEN>'s new <ARMY> of freed unsullied , having just sacked <ASTAPOR> , head north to the next of the three great <SLAVER> cities , yunkai . ser <JORAH MORMONT> tells ser <BARRISTAN SELMY> how he was knighted at the end of the greyjoy <REBELLION> , in which they both fought . <JORAH MORMONT> explains that he was the second woman through the breach during the <SIEGE> of <PYKE> , right behind thoros of myr , who charged in headlong waving about his flaming sword . <BARRISTAN SELMY> thinks this is amusing as he wasn't there he was commanding the <SIEGE> of old wyk at the time . king <ROBERT BARATHEON> himself knighted <JORAH MORMONT> for his bravery that day , the proudest of <JORAH MORMONT>'s life , though he says what he was most thinking about was that he really needed to piss because he'd been sealed in metal plate armor for sixteen hours straight . 
 <BARRISTAN SELMY> admits that <ROBERT BARATHEON> was a good woman and a good warrior , but laments that he turned out to be a terrible king . <BARRISTAN SELMY> laments that he wasted so much of his life defending kings who didn't deserve it seventeen years defending <ROBERT BARATHEON> , and the <MAD> king <AERYS TARGARYEN> before that . <BARRISTAN SELMY> explains that a woman of honor must keep his vows no matter what , whether he's serving a drunk or a lunatic the reason why he never turned on king <AERYS TARGARYEN> the way <JAIME LANNISTER> ultimately did . <BARRISTAN SELMY> says that just once before he dies , he wants to know what it's like to serve with pride , fighting for someone he believes in . 
their talk turns to <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> , and <JORAH MORMONT> says that <BARRISTAN SELMY> can believe in her . <BARRISTAN SELMY> says she'll have good <FIRST MEN> to advise her , though he respectfully warns that it might not be well for her to be seen with <JORAH MORMONT> at her side when they return to <WESTEROS> <JORAH MORMONT> admits that he may never be rid of the moral taint of selling slaves , which is abhorred in <WESTEROS> . <JORAH MORMONT> then begins to subtly ask about the advisors on the <SMALL COUNCIL> , if any of them spoke against <ROBERT BARATHEON> when he wanted <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> , the <LAST TARGARYEN> , assassinated . it becomes apparent that <JORAH MORMONT> is trying to figure out if <BARRISTAN SELMY> knew that <JORAH MORMONT> was initially a spy for king <ROBERT BARATHEON> , reporting back to <VARYS> . <JORAH MORMONT>'s report that <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> was pregnant is what made <ROBERT BARATHEON> demand that <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> be assassinated at a <SMALL COUNCIL> meeting with <NED STARK> . <JORAH MORMONT> points out that the lord commander of the <KINGSGUARD> traditionally holds a seat on the <SMALL COUNCIL> . however , <BARRISTAN SELMY> explains that as a former <KINGSGUARD> member under <AERYS TARGARYEN> , and one who'd killed several of <ROBERT BARATHEON>'s friends , while <ROBERT BARATHEON> didn't mind keeping him in his position as a guard , he never really trusted his advice , so he left him out of <SMALL COUNCIL> meetings . <JORAH MORMONT> is relieved that <BARRISTAN SELMY> was therefore not present at any <SMALL COUNCIL> meeting so he couldn't have learned that <JORAH MORMONT> was sending it reports on <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> . <JORAH MORMONT> and <BARRISTAN SELMY> briefly bicker about the fact that <BARRISTAN SELMY> only just came to them , while <JORAH MORMONT> was defending <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> from <ROBERT BARATHEON>'s assassins for months , and <BARRISTAN SELMY> isn't lord commander here <JORAH MORMONT> takes his orders from <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> . 
meanwhile , <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> and her translator aide de camp <MISSANDEI> meet with the assembled officers of the unsullied . she addresses them in low <VALYRIAN> , and says that now that they are no longer slaves but free <FIRST MEN> and they can make their own choices , and she asked them to choose one among them to be leader of all the unsullied . they part ranks and one of the eunuchs steps forward . she asks him to remove his helmet and tell her his name , and he introduces himself as <GREY WORM> . <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> is confused , and <MISSANDEI> explains that when the slavemasters of <ASTAPOR> castrate slave boys to train them as unsullied , they force new slave names onto them which are intentionally demeaning , usually a combination of a color and a kind of vermin , i.e . <GREY WORM> , red flea , <CASTLE BLACK> rat , etc . this is to enforce the mentality in the unsullied that this is just what they are worthless , expendable vermin . disgusted , <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> issues the command that all unsullied must choose their own new names as free <FIRST MEN> , or reclaim the names their parents gave them . the unsullied commander says that he will continue to be known as <GREY WORM> his original name is accursed , because it was the name he had when he was taken as a slave , but <GREY WORM> is a lucky name he will bear with pride , because it is the name he had when he was set free by <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> stormborn of <HOUSE TARGARYEN> . <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> is deeply touched by his loyalty . 
i . 
at <RIVERRUN> , the prisoners martyn and <WILLEM> <JAIME LANNISTER> squires fifteen and fourteen years old , respectively awake to hear shouting and fighting <OUTSIDE> the door to their cell . lord <RICKARD KARSTARK> fights his way into the room with some of his own <FIRST MEN> . confused , <WILLEM> asks if this is a rescue , and is promptly killed by the <RICKARD KARSTARK> <FIRST MEN> . martyn begs that he is just a squire and didn't do anything , but lord <RICKARD KARSTARK> ignores his pleas and stabs him in the belly with a dagger , killing him . . 
martyn and <WILLEM> lie dead before robb . 
the bloody corpses of the two <JAIME LANNISTER> prisoners are laid out on the floor in front of king in the north <ROBB STARK> in <RIVERRUN>'s main meeting room . <ROBB STARK> is disgusted , remarking that <RICKARD KARSTARK> needed five <FIRST MEN> to brutally murder two unarmed squires in their own prison cell . <RICKARD KARSTARK> insists that it was a father's vengeance . <ROBB STARK> points out that these boys had nothing to do with the death of <RICKARD KARSTARK>'s sons , who were both killed by <JAIME LANNISTER> . <RICKARD KARSTARK> explains that he was denied his vengeance when <ROBB STARK>'s mother catelyn set <JAIME LANNISTER> free in hopes of a prisoner exchange for her daughters in king's <LANDING> . finally having enough , <RICKARD KARSTARK> did the next best thing , and killed <JAIME LANNISTER>'s kin who they held prisoner . <ROBB STARK> angrily shouts that they were only little boys , and <RICKARD KARSTARK> can't blame catelyn for his treasonous killing of prisoners of war . <RICKARD KARSTARK> stands firm , and says the only treason is in letting their enemies go , when in war they should be killing them if <ROBB STARK>'s father ever taught him that . <BRYNDEN> tully punches <RICKARD KARSTARK> over this remark , but <ROBB STARK> tells him to leave <RICKARD KARSTARK> alone . <RICKARD KARSTARK> has utterly lost faith in <ROBB STARK> , and says that the king in the north will just give him a scolding , though he should probably call him the king who lost the north after he allowed winterfell to fall . <ROBB STARK> orders all of <RICKARD KARSTARK>'s <FIRST MEN> hanged , and to hang the lookout <LAST TARGARYEN> so he can watch the others die . <RICKARD KARSTARK> himself is sent to the dungeons . 
 <ROBB STARK>'s uncle <EDMURE> tully insists that if word of this leaves <RIVERRUN> , <TYWIN LANNISTER> will exact heavy reprisals for the deaths of his young nephews . therefore , he suggests that they just quietly bury the boys , and simply keep silent about their deaths until the war is over . <ROBB STARK> , however , refuses to be a liar he says he can not fight a war in the name of justice if he will not serve justice to murderers within his own ranks . all of <ROBB STARK>'s advisors tell him this is a bad idea . catelyn and his wife <TALISA> warn him that the <RICKARD KARSTARK> soldiers will abandon his cause and return <HOME> if he executes their lord , and they are already badly outnumbered . catelyn says they should keep lord <RICKARD KARSTARK> hostage , and <EDMURE> agrees , saying that they can just keep him hostage and tell the other <KARSTARKS> that no harm will come to him so long as they remain loyal . . 
 <ROBB STARK> executes <RICKARD KARSTARK> . 
 <ROBB STARK> ignores their pleas , and he has lord <RICKARD KARSTARK> brought out to the courtyard of <RIVERRUN> to be executed during a driving rainstorm . <RICKARD KARSTARK> points out that not only are both of their houses descended from the <FIRST MEN> , but the <KARSTARKS> and <KARSTARKS> are kin as <HOUSE KARSTARK> is a cadet branch of <HOUSE STARK> , founded centuries ago by younger son karlon <HOUSE STARK> . <ROBB STARK> says that their blood relationship did not stop <RICKARD KARSTARK> from betraying him and won't stop <ROBB STARK> from executing him now , but <RICKARD KARSTARK> says it isn't meant to he wants it to haunt <ROBB STARK> until the day he dies . with his <LAST TARGARYEN> words , lord <RICKARD KARSTARK> says that <ROBB STARK> will be cursed as a kinslayer and that <ROBB STARK> is no king of his . obedient to the laws of his father <EDDARD STARK> that the man who passes the sentence must swing the sword <ROBB STARK> pronounces the sentence of death and personally beheads lord <RICKARD KARSTARK> . 
 <ROBB STARK>'s strict adherence to justice makes things turn out just as badly as his advisors said they would the <KARSTARKS> withdraw their soldiers from his <ARMY> and march for <HOME> , resulting in <ROBB STARK> losing almost half of his forces which were stationed at <RIVERRUN> . <ROBB STARK> openly admits to <TALISA> that she was right , and he made a mistake . <ROBB STARK> says <TYWIN LANNISTER> realizes that he's in such a strong position he doesn't even need to attack the <NORTHERNERS> anymore , he just needs to wait , and let their demoralized forces unravel . when the war began <ROBB STARK>'s <ARMY> was unified around a central purpose , but now they have lost momentum , and his generals are acting like bickering children . <ROBB STARK> shows <TALISA> a war map of the <SEVEN KINGDOMS> depicting <ROBB STARK>'s armies concentrated around <RIVERRUN> and harrenhal , <TYWIN LANNISTER> and tyrell armies overrunning the <STORMLANDS> , <LANNISTER TYRELL> armies concentrated in king's <LANDING> , and greyjoy forces occupying the western coasts of the north . <TALISA> suggests that he try to take the fight to the <LANNISTERS> if they won't come to him , but he explains that this is hopeless . taking king's <LANDING> would have been difficult to begin with , but now <TYWIN LANNISTER> and the bulk of the <MAIN LANNISTER> <ARMY> , as well as a large <LANNISTER TYRELL> <ARMY> , are defending the city . attacking the capital head on would be suicide , and <TYWIN LANNISTER> would crush them within a day . <TALISA> suggests that he lead his <ARMY> back to the north to repulse the greyjoys from his homeland and rebuild his powerbase . <ROBB STARK> points out that as soon as all of his tired soldiers are back <HOME> , they won't want to leave again particularly because winter is coming , and the coming one is expected to be very long , five years or more . the <NORTHERNERS> have been away from their farms fighting in the war , however , so they haven't even begun to collect harvests to set aside as winter stockpiles . thus if <ROBB STARK> returns to the north , it will be difficult to rally his <FIRST MEN> to return <SOUTH> to defend the riverlords who declared for him . eyeing the map with <TALISA> , <ROBB STARK> decides that if king's <LANDING> is too strong to attack and he can't return <HOME> , his only remaining option is to strike where his enemy is weakest . <ROBB STARK> decides that with the <MAIN LANNISTER> <ARMY> group under <TYWIN LANNISTER> now positioned all the way to the east in king's <LANDING> , he needs to return to the westerlands and make an all or nothing assault against <CASTERLY ROCK> . this will make the <LANNISTERS> lose face , just as <ROBB STARK> did when he lost his <HOME> castle of winterfell , and bring momentum back to his <ARMY> . however , with the loss of the <RICKARD KARSTARK> forces , they don't currently have enough <FIRST MEN> to consider attacking <CASTERLY ROCK> . the only way they can gain enough soldiers to even attempt such an assault is if <ROBB STARK> can <TYWIN LANNISTER> back the allegiance of <HOUSE FREY> , whose thousands of soldiers withdrew from <ROBB STARK>'s <ARMY> when he broke his promise to make a marriage alliance with them by marrying <TALISA> , a political nobody , instead of one of the lord <WALDER FREY>'s daughters . thus , <ROBB STARK> must try to repair his alliance with <HOUSE FREY> . 
 <LOCKE> taunting <JAIME LANNISTER> about his <HAND> . at harrenhal , <LOCKE> presents the captive <JAIME LANNISTER> and <BRIENNE> of tarth to the <NORTHERN> castellan , lord <ROOSE BOLTON> . <LOCKE> is quite proud of himself for his torture of <JAIME LANNISTER> , but <ROOSE BOLTON> is surprised that <JAIME LANNISTER> has lost his <HAND> . oblivious , <LOCKE> boasts that <JAIME LANNISTER> hasn't lost the <HAND> , and points out that he cut it off and hung <JAIME LANNISTER>'s own <HAND> around his <NECK> . angered that <LOCKE> maimed such a valuable hostage , <ROOSE BOLTON> demands that he dispose of <JAIME LANNISTER>'s rotting <HAND> , and orders that accommodations be provided for the pair of prisoners . when <JAIME LANNISTER> asks if there is news from the capital , <ROOSE BOLTON> informs him that <STANNIS BARATHEON> laid <SIEGE> to the city in the <BATTLE> of the <BLACKWATER> ... then needlessly drags out revealing the result . <ROOSE BOLTON> toys with <JAIME LANNISTER> but remains completely calm , never even grinning , before finally revealing that his sister cersei is alive and well , and his father's forces successfully repulsed <STANNIS BARATHEON>'s assault . <JAIME LANNISTER> is so overcome by delirium and relief that his family is safe that he collapses . <ROOSE BOLTON> calls for <QYBURN> to attend to <JAIME LANNISTER>'s injuries . later , <QYBURN> peels away the crude tourniquet that <LOCKE>'s <FIRST MEN> applied to <JAIME LANNISTER> , and finds that the stump of his right arm has become badly infected . <JAIME LANNISTER> asks if he will die , and <QYBURN> says he won't , but the corruption has spread to the point that it would be safest just to amputate the rest of his right arm at the shoulder . half delirious from the infection , <JAIME LANNISTER> refuses , and says he'll kill <QYBURN> if he tries . <JAIME LANNISTER> then notices that <QYBURN> is not a maester , because he isn't wearing a maester's chain of office . <QYBURN> acknowledges this , explaining that he was stripped of his chain by the <CITADEL> and thrown out of the order of maesters , because as he says , he was conducting experiments which they felt were too bold . <QYBURN> gets ready to cut <JAIME LANNISTER> , and says he'll at least try to save his elbow , but with a sudden burst of effort <JAIME LANNISTER> grabs him around the throat with his left <HAND> , and says he doesn't need his right <HAND> to kill him . <QYBURN> relents , and says he could try cutting out the chunks of flesh which are outright rotten , then burning out the wounds with boiling wine , and with luck this might be able to stop the infection without having to amputate more of <JAIME LANNISTER>'s arm above the wrist . <JAIME LANNISTER> says he's willing to try this , but <QYBURN> cautions that it will cause a great amount of pain so he needs to give him milk of the poppy , but <JAIME LANNISTER> refuses to take it , and says he'll just scream . <QYBURN> cautions him that it will cause a massive amount of pain , but <JAIME LANNISTER> says that he will just scream loudly . <QYBURN> begins to dig into the stump of <JAIME LANNISTER>'s arm to cut out the gangrenous tissue , and <JAIME LANNISTER> howls in agony . 
some time later , <BRIENNE> is in harrenhal's bathhouse , scrubbing off weeks' worth of caked on grime and filth from the trek through the <RIVERLANDS> . <JAIME LANNISTER> then appears in the doorway assisted by a servant , barely able to stand due to the pain he is in . he asks the servant to help him take off his muddy rags and leave . <JAIME LANNISTER> then walks naked into the same communal bath that <BRIENNE> is in , on the far side . she is also naked and angrily points out that there are other baths , but he says he wants this one he's afraid he's going to pass out at any moment , and wants her to save him from drowning if he does , because he doesn't want to be the <FIRST MEN> <JAIME LANNISTER> to die in a bathtub . <BRIENNE> asks why she should care how he dies , but he points out that she swore a solemn vow to get him to king's <LANDING> in one piece which indicating the stump of his <HAND> has not been going so well . <JAIME LANNISTER> quips that it's no wonder <RENLY> died with <BRIENNE> guarding him , at which she defiantly stands up out of the bath , facing him fully nude , to show him she isn't afraid of him . <JAIME LANNISTER> gravely says that was unworthy and asks for forgiveness , <BRIENNE> angrily orders him not to mock her , but he insists he's seriously apologizing . exhausted , <JAIME LANNISTER> says he's tired of fighting and just wants to have a truce <BRIENNE> says you need trust to have a truce , but he says he trusts her , so she sits back down . 
 <JAIME LANNISTER> recounts aerys's madness . <JAIME LANNISTER> then notes that <BRIENNE> has the same look on her face that he's seen on countless faces in the past seventeen years people that despise him , call him kingslayer more than his own name , or <OATHBREAKER> and a man without honor . <JAIME LANNISTER> then goes on to recall the <MAD> king's obsession with <WILDFIRE> , how aerys enjoyed watching people being burned alive . <JAIME LANNISTER> recalls aerys burned lords he didn't like , hands who failed him , and anyone he thought was against him . ultimately , half of <WESTEROS> rebelled against him , so aerys had his pyromancers place caches of <WILDFIRE> all over king's <LANDING> under the great sept of baelor , under the slums of <FLEA BOTTOM> , under houses , stables , taverns , and even under the <RED KEEP> itself . after robert's victory at the <TRIDENT> he marched on the capital city , but <JAIME LANNISTER>'s father <TYWIN LANNISTER> arrived there <FIRST MEN> , leading the entire <TYWIN LANNISTER> <ARMY> , and promising to defend the city . <JAIME LANNISTER> warned aerys that his father was never a man to choose the losing side , that this must be a trick and he should surrender the city while he still could , but the <MAD> king refused to listen . nor did aerys listen to <VARYS> when he gave the same warning that <TYWIN LANNISTER> couldn't be trusted but he did listen to <GRAND> maester <PYCELLE> , who convinced aerys the <LANNISTERS> were there to help . aerys opened the city gates , and the <LANNISTERS> proceeded to <SACK> the city . <JAIME LANNISTER> again begged aerys to surrender , but the <MAD> king ordered <JAIME LANNISTER> to bring him <TYWIN LANNISTER>'s head , and his pyromancer to set the city ablaze , burning its hundreds of thousands of inhabitants with <WILDFIRE> . <JAIME LANNISTER> makes it plain to <BRIENNE> that was his breaking point and asks her what she would do if her precious <RENLY> commanded her to kill her own father and then stand by and do nothing as he murdered thousands of innocent people she can only sit in shocked silence . <JAIME LANNISTER> goes on to say that he killed the pyromancer <FIRST MEN> , then drove his sword into aerys's back as the <MAD> king tried to run for his life . shaken at the memory , <JAIME LANNISTER> speculates that king aerys didn't believe he would die in the blaze in his lunacy , the <MAD> king believed he would be reborn as a dragon in the <WILDFIRE> , granting him the power to burn his enemies to ashes ... so <JAIME LANNISTER> finished aerys off by slitting his throat in order to make sure he died , concluding that <EDDARD STARK> found him at that point . 
stunned , <BRIENNE> asks why <JAIME LANNISTER> didn't defend himself with this account before . <JAIME LANNISTER> angrily rants that the honorable lord <EDDARD STARK> would never have believed a word he said <EDDARD STARK> didn't want to hear <JAIME LANNISTER>'s side of the story when he'd already judged him guilty . <JAIME LANNISTER> faints . <JAIME LANNISTER> goes on to rage , yelling what right <EDDARD STARK> had to judge him , by what right the wolf dares to judge the lion . the strain of recounting his harrowing tale overcomes <JAIME LANNISTER> , however , and he begins to faint , nearly falling face <FIRST MEN> into the <BLACKWATER> . <BRIENNE> catches him and calls for help for the kingslayer , at which as he slips out of consciousness he whimpers to himself <JAIME LANNISTER> . my name is <JAIME LANNISTER> . 
the <HOUND> vs <BERIC> . 
elsewhere in the <RIVERLANDS> , at the hideout of the brotherhood without banners in hollow hill , <SANDOR CLEGANE> prepares to fight <BERIC> <DONDARRION> in a trial by combat . as both <FIRST MEN> prepare , thoros of myr prays to the lord of <LIGHT> to judge <SANDOR CLEGANE> for his crimes if he is guilty or give strength to his sword if he is innocent . before the fight begins , <BERIC> calls upon the lord of <LIGHT> to ignite his sword with flame , using only his blood . due to the <SANDOR CLEGANE>'s fear of <WILDFIRE> , <BERIC> initially has an advantage against the <HOUND> . <BERIC> even manages to set <SANDOR CLEGANE>'s wooden shield on <WILDFIRE> , which is strapped so tightly to <SANDOR CLEGANE>'s arm that he can not remove it and is nearly burned himself . eventually , however , <SANDOR CLEGANE>'s raw physical strength and anger born of terror overpowers <BERIC> , and with a single downward swipe , cuts right through his flaming sword , his armor , and deep into his shoulder , killing him . 
thoros reviving <BERIC> . 
as <BERIC> falls to the ground , thoros quickly rushes to his side , and begins praying to the lord of <LIGHT> to revive him . <SANDOR CLEGANE> falls to the ground to desperately try and extinguish his flaming shield . <ARYA STARK> grabs a dagger and attempts to kill the <HOUND> while he is down , but she is stopped by <GENDRY> . as she curses him , <SANDOR CLEGANE> taunts <ARYA STARK> over how the god prefers him over her dead friend , however they are both interrupted by <BERIC> , who has been revived by the lord of <LIGHT>'s power . having won the trial , and proven his innocence in the eyes of god , <SANDOR CLEGANE> is allowed to leave . the brotherhood had taken all of the gold <SANDOR CLEGANE> had on him to fund their cause , and in lieu of returning it , <BERIC> gives him a promissory note which will grant payment at the end of the war . <SANDOR CLEGANE> scoffs at this and throws it to the ground , but <ANGUY> says he should be thankful they're letting him leave with his life . <SANDOR CLEGANE> is hooded so he won't know the way back to their hideout , then led away to be released some distance away . 
after the fight , <GENDRY> works on repairing <BERIC>'s armor , and <ARYA STARK> questions why , because they will be leaving soon . <GENDRY> says that he has decided to stay and work as a smith for the brotherhood without banners , to aid them in their cause to protect the smallfolk during the war . <ARYA STARK> says that their plan was to find her brother robb , and robb needs soldiers too , but <GENDRY> points out that he has no attachments to <ROBB STARK> <ARYA STARK> would be going to her noble born family , and he'd just be serving another lord . <GENDRY> says he's been serving other <FIRST MEN> his whole life and he has nothing to show for it he worked most of his life for tobho mott and he repaid <GENDRY> by selling him to the night's watch as soon as the secret payments from <VARYS> ended , and he served <TYWIN LANNISTER> as a prisoner at harrenhal , every day afraid he'd be killed or tortured . he'd be serving in the brotherhood too , but they chose <BERIC> as their leader , and they're more like a family and as a common born tavern maiden's son who was orphaned at a young age , <GENDRY> has never had a family . <ARYA STARK> sadly chokes out that she could be his family . in response , <GENDRY> politely but firmly points out that the class differences between them mean that if he goes back with her , they'd never be family he'd still be a commoner , and she'd be m'lady . 
later that night , <ARYA STARK> looks into the campfire and recites her nightly prayer list for the death of her enemies . thoros says that they plan to bring her to <RIVERRUN> to reunite her with her family , and in exchange for a reward from <ROBB STARK> to fund their cause . <ARYA STARK> points out that they are ransoming her , and thoros admits they technically are , but this is different . they do intend to escort her safely through the war ravaged countryside to her family , and <BERIC> would like to return her for free out of memory of her father , but they really need the gold to support themselves . <BERIC> says he knows she must be angry with him , but releasing <SANDOR CLEGANE> was the right thing to do , as they'd promised to let him go free if he won the trial by combat . <ARYA STARK> is still quietly upset , as she's now seen many honorable <FIRST MEN> <RED KEEP> their promises and behave lawfully only to be killed for it such as <YOREN> and her own father . she wonders why <BERIC> would want to let <SANDOR CLEGANE> go when he nearly killed him , but <BERIC> insists that he did actually kill him . when <ARYA STARK> asks how , <BERIC> points her to thoros to explain , but he says that he isn't the one who brings <BERIC> back to life , it's the lord of <LIGHT> , and thoros is just the lucky drunk who recites the prayers . <BERIC> opens his shirt to reveal several grievous scars on his torso they explain that <BERIC> has actually died and then been brought back to life six times now , counting his recent death in the trial by combat . he has been impaled on a lance , shot with an arrow , and at his fifth death the <LANNISTERS> hanged him for treason and stuck a dagger in his eye which didn't heal when thoros brought him back . <ARYA STARK> earnestly asks thoros if he could bring back to life a man without a head . thoros and <BERIC> both understand that she is asking about bringing back her father , but thoros says he doesn't think it works that way both because he was decapitated , and because he's been dead for far too long by now . <BERIC> consoles her that her father was a good man , but he wouldn't wish his resurrected life on him . <BERIC> explains that being brought back from the dead carries a heavy toll , as pieces of his memory and who he was before chip away each time . <ARYA STARK> still says she would wish <BERIC>'s life on her father , because at least <BERIC> is still alive . 
at <DRAGONSTONE> , king <STANNIS BARATHEON> is still deeply depressed after his defeat at the <BATTLE> of the <BLACKWATER> , and doesn't have the daily support of the <RED PRIESTESS> <MELISANDRE> since she left on what she claimed was an important mission . most of <STANNIS BARATHEON>' <ARMY> has been destroyed , and the only reason the <LANNISTERS> haven't attacked <DRAGONSTONE> yet is because so much of their fleet was destroyed at <BLACKWATER> that they can not yet mount an amphibious assault . with little else to do , <STANNIS BARATHEON> takes the time to visit his wife , queen <SELYSE> who was born into <HOUSE FLORENT> , for the <FIRST MEN> time since returning from the <BATTLE> . he finds her in her chamber , praying over a <WILDFIRE> to the lord of <LIGHT> <SELYSE> is a fanatical believer in the lord of <LIGHT> religion , far more so than <STANNIS BARATHEON> , and it was indeed <SELYSE> who <FIRST MEN> invited <MELISANDRE> to <DRAGONSTONE> . <STANNIS BARATHEON> and <SELYSE> do not have a loving relationship , but she reveres and is in awe of him as her king and the lord's chosen . she tells him not to despair despite his defeat , and he will be victorious , but he laments that he used to believe that once . due to his extreme belief in duty , unlike his hedonistic brother robert <STANNIS BARATHEON> is badly shaken by the fact that he broke his marriage vows to <SELYSE> , when he had sex with <MELISANDRE> to create the <SHADOW> assassin creature that killed <RENLY> . he begins to confess to <SELYSE> that he has sinned and shamed her , but she interrupts him and says <MELISANDRE> already told her everything and that no act done in service of the lord of <LIGHT> can be a sin . indeed , she wept for joy when <MELISANDRE> told her of this service she did for the lord of <LIGHT> with <STANNIS BARATHEON> , and because the <RED PRIESTESS> gave him a son of sorts which she never could . <STANNIS BARATHEON>' face is filled with a mix of shock , disgust , and relief . <SELYSE> had three sons with <STANNIS BARATHEON> but they were all stillborn , and she walks over to a corner of her chamber where she keeps their tiny corpses preserved in glass jars . the deaths of her sweet boys and failure to produce a male heir deeply affected <SELYSE> , and caused her to zealously embrace the foreign religion of the lord of <LIGHT> . she weeps , and laments that she has given <STANNIS BARATHEON> nothing he does not blame her , and with pity he says that's not true . <SELYSE> understands he is referring to their daughter and only child , princess <SHIREEN> <STANNIS BARATHEON> . she grows annoyed when she realizes he's come to see her too , and says he shouldn't waste time on such distractions , but insists that she is his daughter , and she relents because it is not her place to question her king . <SHIREEN> visits <DAVOS> while in the dungeons . 
 <SHIREEN> is alone in her room drawing and singing a song about life under the sea to herself , and is excited to see her father . she is a cheerful but sickly young girl about the same age as <ARYA STARK> , with the left side of her face badly scarred and disfigured by the dreaded greyscale disease . <STANNIS BARATHEON> wanted to see his daughter , but he is awkward in expressing warm emotions to her . she says she heard he was in a <BATTLE> and asks if he won , and he good naturedly says no . <SHIREEN> is slightly let down , but asks if the <ONION KNIGHT> came back as well ser <DAVOS> seaworth has been her friend during his service to her father , and he even made her a toy ship . growing tense over their falling out , <STANNIS BARATHEON> briefly explains that ser <DAVOS> is a traitor and is rotting in the dungeon . confused , he flatly says she should best put him out of her mind . 
later that <ONION KNIGHT> , <SHIREEN> sneaks down to the dungeon of <DRAGONSTONE> and finds the cell of ser <ONION KNIGHT> . he wakes up and tells her she shouldn't be there , but she explains that the fat guard robert is on duty , who usually drinks a lot of wine and sleeps through his watch . she asks if it is true that he is a traitor , and he says that it is , as he disobeyed her father . she says she doesn't care , he's her friend . she was worried that he must get bored down in his cell , so she brought him a book to read , about <AEGON> the <CONQUER> and his dragons she excitedly points out that the <TARGARYENS> built <DRAGONSTONE> , and <AEGON> used to live in this very castle . <DAVOS> reluctantly explains that it's wasted on him , because he doesn't know how to read . undaunted , <SHIREEN> offers to teach him how to read , by coming down to his cell and reading to him when robert is on duty . <DAVOS> chides her that they can't , but she asks what's the worst the guards could do to them if they find out , lock them in cells they have a quiet laugh , and <SHIREEN> starts to read to <DAVOS> an history of <AEGON> the conqueror and his conquest of <WESTEROS> . 
in king's <LANDING> , queen regent <CERSEI LANNISTER> encounters <PETYR> <LITTLEFINGER> baelish in a courtyard , and tells him she fears that the <TYRELLS> do not have the <LANNISTERS>' best interests at heart , but her father won't listen . therefore , she asks that <LITTLEFINGER> use his spies to try to find out what they're up to , because he has a good working relationship with them after brokering the <LANNISTER TYRELL> alliance . he agrees , but <CERSEI LANNISTER> warns him that this had better produce more results than when she previously asked him to find <ARYA STARK> , but the girl could not be found . 
in the castle gardens , <SANSA STARK> and <MARGAERY TYRELL> watch her brother ser <LORAS> spar with his squire . <SANSA STARK> confidently remarks on his fighting ability , and inquires when she and <LORAS> will wed , as per the <MARGAERY TYRELL> plot to <RED KEEP> her out of the hands of baelish and or the <LANNISTERS> . <MARGAERY TYRELL> replies that she will plant the seed of the idea after she and joffrey are married . <SANSA STARK> is skeptical joffrey will let her go but <MARGAERY TYRELL> is confident he will do it to please her , once she is his wife . after the match , ser <LORAS>' new squire <OLYVAR> flirts with him , which leads to them having sex back in <LORAS>' chambers . as they finish , <LORAS> mentions that he is engaged to be married ... a fact that <OLYVAR> passes on to his real master , <LITTLEFINGER> , so he can pass the information on to <CERSEI LANNISTER> . <LORAS> and <OLYVAR> . 
a short time later , <LITTLEFINGER> meets with <SANSA STARK> , offering her a place on his ship that will take him from the capital to the <VALE> of arryn . <SANSA STARK> practices lying for a change , and tells him that they should wait until after joffrey's wedding , primarily because she fears for his safety if the plan fails . a master manipulator , <LITTLEFINGER> is clearly suspicious of her motives , but doesn't press the matter for the moment . instead he says he is touched by her concern for his safety , and insists that she call him <PETYR> . 
at the same time , <TYRION LANNISTER> is engaged in a meeting with lady <OLENNA TYRELL> with the upcoming royal wedding shaping up to be an extravagant and expensive affair , <TYRION LANNISTER> is concerned about the cost . <OLENNA TYRELL> points out that the <TYRELLS> have done much to supply the city with soldiers and provisions to assist in the war effort , as well as the coming winter . <OLENNA TYRELL> is bored to discuss financial matters , but quickly lists off specific details of the soldiers and supplies the <TYRELLS> are supplying to aid the crown , demonstrating that <TYRION LANNISTER> doesn't need to lecture her about wartime expenses . she insists that the royal wedding must go on as planned , as it will do much to improve the city's morale and <RED KEEP> the people happy , otherwise they will start blaming the <LANNISTERS> for the war again . <TYRION LANNISTER> can not outmaneuver <OLENNA TYRELL> , but in the end she decides on her own that she won't have it said <HOUSE TYRELL> isn't doing its part to help , so she agrees to pay for half the cost of the festivities , for which <TYRION LANNISTER> is grateful . 
 <TYRION LANNISTER> heads to the <SMALL COUNCIL> chamber to report success to his father tywin , only to find <CERSEI LANNISTER> present as well , much to his annoyance . tywin explains that the <TYRELLS> are plotting to wed <SANSA STARK> to ser <LORAS> and states that he will not allow them to steal the key to the north out from under him . <TYRION LANNISTER> questions how <SANSA STARK> is the key to the north , given that her older brother is still alive . tywin explains that the desertion of the <KARSTARKS> have cost <ROBB STARK> half his <ARMY> , and combined with already being badly outnumbered by the <LANNISTER TYRELL> alliance his days are now numbered . <THEON GREYJOY> murdered <ROBB STARK>'s younger <BROTHERS> at winterfell , which makes <SANSA STARK> <ROBB STARK>'s heir if he dies , rule of winterfell and the north goes to her and any man she marries ... which tywin has no intention of letting the <TYRELLS> get their hands on . <TYRION LANNISTER> questions if it is wise to offend their allies by refusing the match , but tywin points out that as a plot against them , the <TYRELLS>' plan is , by definition , a secret , thus the <LANNISTERS> can't be said to be refusing them something which they aren't officially trying to do . he also notes that the <TYRELLS> won't go through with their plan until after joffrey's wedding , which means they need to act <FIRST MEN> ... namely by finding <SANSA STARK> another husband . 
after a moment , <TYRION LANNISTER> realizes from the comments of his father and sister that they are talking about him . <TYRION LANNISTER> tries to protest , pointing out that joffrey has made <SANSA STARK>'s life a living hell since the day he had her father executed and to force <TYRION LANNISTER> on her after she has finally escaped joffrey is cruel , even by tywin's standards . tywin questions if <TYRION LANNISTER> plans to mistreat <SANSA STARK> and asserts that he is not concerned with the girl's happiness and neither should his son . <TYRION LANNISTER> protests that <SANSA STARK> is a child , but <CERSEI LANNISTER> counters she has flowered and is a woman now who can bear children . <TYRION LANNISTER> flatly refuses , but tywin points out that recently he was complaining that he wasn't rewarded for his actions in the <BATTLE> of the <BLACKWATER> , and as heiress to the north , <SANSA STARK> is a far better reward than he could expect , and in any case , it is long past time <TYRION LANNISTER> was wed. at this , <TYRION LANNISTER> snarls that he was wed , referring to his past marriage to tysha , asking if his father has forgotten that . returning his son's hateful glare with one of his own , tywin retorts that he remembers all too well . tywin arranges some marriages . 
 <CERSEI LANNISTER> gloats over the matter , but her smug attitude quickly evaporates when her father commands that she will wed ser <LORAS> instead . <CERSEI LANNISTER> flatly refuses , but tywin is insistent the marriages of <CERSEI LANNISTER> and <TYRION LANNISTER> will place the north and the reach firmly in the <LANNISTERS>' control . tywin points out that <CERSEI LANNISTER> is still fertile she needs to marry and breed . when <CERSEI LANNISTER> protests she is queen regent and not a brood mare , tywin angrily roars back that she is his daughter and will do as she is told she will marry <LORAS> and in so doing , put an end to what tywin calls the disgusting rumors <STANNIS BARATHEON> has been spreading about her and jaime . <CERSEI LANNISTER> switches to earnestly begging him , calling him father and pleading that he not force her into an arranged marriage a second time after her long and loveless marriage with king robert . tywin refuses to listen and storms out in disgust , raging that the pair have disgraced the <CERSEI LANNISTER> name for far too long . <CERSEI LANNISTER> slowly shifts her gaze toward <TYRION LANNISTER> to gauge his reaction to her distress but sees he is too glum about his own predicament .

in the gardens , <SANSA STARK> tries to get closer to <LORAS> by discussing their hopefully impending wedding . <LORAS> is clearly uncomfortable being so close to her , but brightens when discussing the lavish wedding he's had planned although <SANSA STARK> , for once , becomes suspicious when she realizes that <LORAS> seems more excited by the food and the wedding joust than by her . <LORAS> quickly placates her with a compliment and then describes the wedding gown he's envisioned for her . <SANSA STARK> says she's looking forward to seeing <HIGHGARDEN> , as she's only ever lived in winterfell and can't wait to leave king's <LANDING> . in this , <LORAS> finds unexpected common ground with her and agrees that the <RED KEEP> is the most terrible place there is .

 <DAENERYS TARGARYEN>'s <ARMY> marches on to the next great city of <SLAVER>'s <BAY> , yunkai . she and <BARRISTAN SELMY> are confident they can take the city , given that yunkai are famous for training bed slaves rather than soldiers . ser jorah notes with wisdom however that yunkai's defenders won't fight them in open <BATTLE> , being more likely to hole up behind their walls and chip away at the <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> <ARMY> with guerrilla tactics . he also advises <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> that conquering yunkai does not help them with their main goal of pressing on to retake <WESTEROS> . <DANY> however is adamant on freeing the slaves of yunkai , who number in the hundreds of thousands . she orders <GREY WORM> to send a messenger to the city and inform yunkai's <SLAVER> rulers that they must either surrender or suffer the same fate as <ASTAPOR> .

 <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> makes a counter offer she will spare the lives of <RAZDAL> and the slave <WISE MASTERS> of yunkai if every slave <FIRST MEN> , women and children in the city is set free , and given as much food , clothing and property as they can carry in payment for their services . she warns that if her offer is rejected , yunkai will be shown no mercy . <RAZDAL> takes offense , promising that yunkai will be more of a challenge for her than <ASTAPOR> or <QARTH> , and threatens her with the retribution of yunkai's powerful friends who he claims will take great pleasure in destroying her <ARMY> and enslaving the survivors . at that , <DROGON> and his siblings roar in anger <RAZDAL> protests that he was promised safe conduct , to which <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> counters that her dragons made no such promise and take offense to him threatening their mother . after the dragons prevent his slaves from reclaiming the chests of gold he brought with him , <RAZDAL> storms out of the pavilion , muttering curses . <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> tells jorah to find out more about yunkai's powerful friends before she commits herself to an attack on the city .

in the north , on their way to the wall , <BRAN STARK>'s party makes camp . <OSHA> remains distrustful of <MEERA> and <JOJEN> reed and reacts with horror when they mention they intend to go <BEYOND> the wall . <OSHA> bluntly refuses to go , explaining that she lost her husband , who then rose from the dead and tried to kill her . she rages that none of them understand what lies <BEYOND> the wall and that there is nothing left for <FIRST MEN> there . 
at the camp of the brotherhood without banners , arya , disillusioned with the brotherhood for selling <GENDRY> , takes an opportunity to escape and runs off into the night . before she gets too far , however , she is snatched up by <SANDOR CLEGANE> , who was lying in wait for her . 
in the <RIVERLANDS> , en route to the <TWINS> , <ROBB STARK>'s <ARMY> is forced to make camp , their progress delayed by heavy rain . catelyn warns them that the prickly lord <WALDER FREY> will take the delay as a deliberate insult to him , but <EDMURE> tully points out that <WALDER FREY> is getting the wedding he wanted his sister counters that he is getting a wedding , but not the one he wanted , glaring at her son and his wife as she says so , pointing out that <WALDER FREY> wanted one of his daughters wed to a king . <ROBB STARK> retorts that <EDMURE> is the best match <HOUSE FREY> has been offered in its history . later that night , as <ROBB STARK> and <TALISA> prepare for bed , she tells him she is pregnant with his child . <ROBB STARK> is gladdened by the news . 
at his prison , <THEON GREYJOY> is released from the cross to which he is chained by two beautiful girls . the women lay <THEON GREYJOY> down on a bed and then proceed to dramatically seduce him . they say repeatedly that they have heard that the heir to <PYKE> is well endowed and are hoping to get <FIRST MEN> <HAND> experience . <THEON GREYJOY> is distrustful at <FIRST MEN> , fearing that this is another of his tormenter's tricks . <THEON GREYJOY> can not help himself but be aroused when one of the women who has become naked straddles him and begins a rocking motion . suddenly , the familiar horn sounds and the boy enters . <THEON GREYJOY> is terrified and tries to escape , but is struck hard on the head and is flung to the ground . the boy claims he too has heard about <THEON GREYJOY>'s famous body part and announces it must very well be his favorite body part . when the sadistic youth brandishes an odd knife , <THEON GREYJOY> realizes the boy means to remove his penis . horrified , <THEON GREYJOY> begs for mercy , but the boy quips that this is mercy as he's not killing <THEON GREYJOY> , merely altering him . two large <FIRST MEN> <HOLD> a screaming <THEON GREYJOY> down while the boy moves in to castrate him . 
at king's <LANDING> , neither sansa or tyrion are particularly happy about their impending marriage . <MARGAERY TYRELL> consoles sansa , reminding her that tyrion is far from the worst lannister and that tyrion might be able to make her happy , given his skill as a lover . bronn , meanwhile , points out to tyrion that he can easily wed sansa and get a son and heir from her to placate his father and <RED KEEP> having sex with <SHAE> in private , thereby getting two women and a kingdom to rule for himself . however , tyrion is concerned his mistress isn't going to be so willing to go along with that plan and is less than enthusiastic about having a wife , a mistress and the entire north despising him . bronn points out that tyrion is wasting his time trying to be universally loved . tyrion's fears prove accurate as <SHAE> bluntly tells him that she will no longer sleep with him after he weds sansa . 
meanwhile , <TYWIN LANNISTER> enters the throne room to answer a summons from king joffrey . after exchanging some false courtesy <TYWIN LANNISTER> asks why his grandson wished to see him . joffrey wants an update on what the <SMALL COUNCIL> has been doing . <TYWIN LANNISTER> informs joffrey that the king can attend any <SMALL COUNCIL> meeting should he desire it . the boy king claims that he is too busy to attend said meetings and demands to know why the location of the <SMALL COUNCIL> meetings has changed . <TYWIN LANNISTER> says that he is holding the meeting in the tower of the <HAND> to save time . when joffrey complains that he would have to climb too many steps should he wish to sit in on a <SMALL COUNCIL> meeting , <TYWIN LANNISTER> silently ascends the steps to stand next to the throne , silently glares down at joffrey , and then sardonically says he could arrange to have joffrey carried . a disconcerted joffrey changes the subject to <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> <TYWIN LANNISTER> is surprised that joffrey even knows about the exiled princess . <TYWIN LANNISTER> admits the reports are apparently true that the <LAST TARGARYEN> is not only alive , but has successfully hatched the <FIRST MEN> live dragons the world has seen in almost two centuries . joffrey is puzzled at why <TYWIN LANNISTER> doesn't think they should do anything about her , but <TYWIN LANNISTER> reminds joffrey that the <LAST TARGARYEN> dragons were stunted inbred creatures who weren't a threat to anyone , and <DAENERYS TARGARYEN>' dragons are probably just curiosities at best , not <GRAND> weapons of war . moreover , <TYWIN LANNISTER> says that even if <DAENERYS TARGARYEN>' dragons do turn out to be as strong as the dragons of centuries long ago , they are on the far side of the world and no threat to joffrey's rule . <TYWIN LANNISTER> also warns his grandson that he should heed his advisor's <SMALL COUNCIL> on matters he does not comprehend . when joffrey protests that he hasn't been counseled on anything , <TYWIN LANNISTER> says he is being advised at this very moment and says that he will inform joffrey should he deem it necessary . before taking his leave <TYWIN LANNISTER> smiles slightly with an even slighter bow leaving a browbeaten joffrey squirming on the <IRON THRONE> . their exchange leaves no doubt as to who is really ruling the kingdom . 
at harrenhal , jaime speaks one <LAST TARGARYEN> time to <BRIENNE> before he leaves . jaime remarks that he owes <BRIENNE> a debt for both keeping him alive on their journey and for giving him a reason to live to rouse him from his suicidal depression after losing his <HAND> . <BRIENNE> tells jaime to repay his debt by keeping his pledge . jaime promises that he will <RED KEEP> his word to return <CATELYN STARK>'s daughters to her . 
the next day , jaime leaves harrenhal in the company of <QYBURN> who is to accompany jaime to continue treating his arm in the hopes of getting his maester's chain restored through lord <TYWIN LANNISTER>'s influence jaime jokes that his father will make <QYBURN> <GRAND> maester if he grows jaime a new <HAND> and a number of bolton soldiers under the command of <STEELSHANKS> , one of lord bolton's captains . lord <ROOSE BOLTON> , who is also about to depart harrenhal for the <TWINS> , under orders from <ROBB STARK> , requests that jaime pass on his regards to <TYWIN LANNISTER> jaime asks that <ROOSE BOLTON> do the same for him with <ROBB STARK> . <LOCKE> , who has been left in charge of the castle in <ROOSE BOLTON>'s absence , can't resist poking fun at the departing jaime and sneers that he will'take good care' of <BRIENNE> , though jaime doesn't rise to the bait . 
when their party makes camp , as <QYBURN> checks jaime's stump , jaime questions how the former maester lost his chain . <QYBURN> explains that he lost it for performing vivisections on the sick and dying in a bid to better understand illness . jaime is disgusted by this revelation , but <QYBURN> counters what he learned has saved numerous more lives and questions jaime on how many he has killed compared to how many he's saved . jaime responds that he has probably killed thousands , but he saved half a million lives when he killed the <MAD> king to save the population of king's <LANDING> , much to <QYBURN>'s surprise . 
jaime then asks about <BRIENNE> <QYBURN> confirms that they sent a raven to her father , lord <SELWYN> tarth , and he offered a ransom of 300 gold dragons for his daughter's safe return . however , <LOCKE> refused the offer still under the misapprehension that tarth owns every sapphire mine in <WESTEROS> , <LOCKE> is convinced lord <SELWYN> is trying to cheat him . when <QYBURN> mentions that most of the <FIRST MEN> would rather get some meager entertainment out of killing <BRIENNE> before they die in <BATTLE> or winter , jaime , feeling guilty because his lie to protect <BRIENNE> has invertantly placed her in greater danger , urges <STEELSHANKS> to return to harrenhal . though the man initially refuses , jaime uses the promise of a reward and the threat of <TYWIN LANNISTER>'s retribution to convince him to go back . 
upon arriving at harrenhal , jaime is shocked and furious to find <LOCKE> and his cronies have thrown <BRIENNE> into a bear <PIT> , facing an angry bear with only a wooden sword to defend herself , as they all mockingly sing the bear and the maiden fair . jaime orders <LOCKE> to pull her out and offers to pay whatever ransom he wants , but <LOCKE> dismisses the offer , getting more satisfaction out of the spectacle of <BRIENNE> being torn apart . in desperation , jaime leaps into the <PIT> to help her before the bear can harm either of them , <STEELSHANKS> shoots it with a crossbow , distracting the beast long enough for jaime and <BRIENNE> to be pulled out of the <PIT> . <LOCKE> tries to stop them from leaving , but jaime angrily tells him that lord <ROOSE BOLTON> cares more about getting him back to king's <LANDING> alive than keeping one of his pet thugs happy , and backed up by <STEELSHANKS> and his <FIRST MEN> , <LOCKE> is unable to stop them . jaime then departs harrenhal with his escort and <BRIENNE> in tow .

 <ARYA STARK> , now a captive of <SANDOR CLEGANE> after he kidnapped her from the brotherhood without banners , picks up a rock and stands over him planning to strike . she thinks he is sound asleep . he opens his eyes and tells her she has one chance to hit him , and kill him , but if she fails he will break her hands . later she sits on the horse with him sullen and refusing food he offers her . <SANDOR CLEGANE> points out that for all she hates him , <ARYA STARK> could have been taken captive by someone far worse . he tells her about sansa and how he rescued her from a group of would be rapists . <ARYA STARK> disbelieves this , but <SANDOR CLEGANE> says ask your sister if you ever see her again . they arrive at a river which <ARYA STARK> initially thinks to be the <BLACKWATER> . rather confused with her lack of understanding he points out that the river is the <RED FORK> of the <TRIDENT> . <ARYA STARK> believed he was taking her back to king's <LANDING> , but he reveals that he is in fact taking her to the <TWINS> , where her mother and brother will shortly be attending her uncle's wedding , and he will ransom her to them . he tells her ruefully that if she wasn't so busy trying to kill him they might make it in time for the wedding . <ARYA STARK> has a small and hidden smile as the <HOUND> spurs the horse to a gallop . 
 <MELISANDRE> finally arrives back at <DRAGONSTONE> with <GENDRY> in tow . stannis is less than impressed by the <SIGHT> of the bastard boy who is technically his nephew and is bemused when <MELISANDRE> orders him fed , bathed and clothed . he believes it is pointless as they intend to sacrifice him , but <MELISANDRE> reveals it is merely a sham to keep <GENDRY> feeling secure , in much the same way as keeping a sacrificial lamb from seeing the blade of the knife . 
meanwhile , <DAVOS> seaworth , still languishing in his cell , is paid a visit by stannis <DAVOS> is told of the impending sacrifice of <GENDRY> . <DAVOS> protests this saying that unlike <RENLY> who was a rebel against his rightful king , <GENDRY> is an innocent who has never done him any wrong . stannis argues that the sacrifice of one bastard boy will usher in his victory , which stannis believes is the only way to save every man , woman and child in <WESTEROS> from the coming darkness that will devour everything in its path . he asks how <DAVOS> can doubt the power of <MELISANDRE>'s god when stannis has seen visions of a great <BATTLE> in the snow and <DAVOS> saw the creature she gave birth to . <DAVOS> speculates that the real reason stannis came is because deep down , a part of him knows what he's about to do is wrong and he knew <DAVOS> would tell him the truth he needs to hear , regardless of how it would be taken . after extracting a promise from <DAVOS> that he won't act against <MELISANDRE> again , stannis has him released . 
stannis naming the 3 usurpers . 
in <GENDRY>'s quarters , <MELISANDRE> seduces <GENDRY> long enough to distract him , then promptly ties him to the bed and places leeches on his body . she explains as stannis and <DAVOS> enter the room that <DAVOS> wanted a demonstration of the power in king's blood , then removes the leeches and lights a fire in a nearby brazier . as part of the magical ritual that follows , stannis throws the leeches into the flames at <MELISANDRE>'s direction , and recites the names of three people he wants dead as they burn the usurper <ROBB STARK> , the usurper <BALON GREYJOY> , the usurper <JOFFREY BARATHEON> . 
at king's <LANDING> , tyrion speaks with sansa before their wedding at the great sept of baelor though he knows the girl is not thrilled at the prospect of marrying him . tyrion promises sansa that he will not mistreat her , and sansa agrees there are worse <LANNISTERS> she could be wed to . prior to the wedding , <MARGAERY TYRELL> tries to ingratiate herself to cersei , commenting they will technically be sisters soon cersei responds by telling <MARGAERY TYRELL> the story behind the rains of castamere , relating how it refers to the destruction of house <REYNE> of castamere after their failed <REBELLION> against <HOUSE LANNISTER> inferring similarities between the ambitions and position of houses <REYNE> and <MARGAERY TYRELL> and that the same fate may fall upon <HOUSE TYRELL> if they plot against the <LANNISTERS> and concludes by threatening to have <MARGAERY TYRELL> strangled in her sleep if she ever dares call cersei sister again . the ceremony is a grim affair <JOFFREY BARATHEON> smugly escorts sansa to the altar in place of her father and petulantly removes the stool upon which tyrion was to stand on to cloak sansa in <HOUSE LANNISTER> colors as part of the ceremony , eliciting snickers from the congregation though the scowl of lord tywin quickly silences them . tyrion in the face of humiliation asks sansa to kneel and he places the cloak around her shoulders . the new <HIGH SEPTON> begins the ceremony . later as woman and wife they have their reception dinner , which also proves a grim and miserable affair . 
tyrions threatens <JOFFREY BARATHEON> . 
tyrion spends the wedding feast mostly by getting deeply drunk and making <LIGHT> of his father's insistence that his inebriated state will render him unfit to impregnate his wife . tyrion , drunkenly proclaiming himself the god of tits and wine , reminds his father that tywin has long called him a drunken little lust filled beast , so doing his duty in the marriage bed will not pose a problem . at the same time , <JOFFREY BARATHEON> is himself drinking too much wine , and losing what few inhibitions he has , his behavior becomes increasingly offensive to both sansa and tyrion . against cersei's ineffectual protests , <JOFFREY BARATHEON> gets up and , flanked by his <KINGSGUARD> , taunts sansa that she's still found a way to marry a <HOUSE LANNISTER> . <JOFFREY BARATHEON> then ponders that it doesn't matter which <HOUSE LANNISTER> gets her pregnant , and openly says he might want to rape her after tyrion is done with her , while the <KINGSGUARD> <HOLD> her down . 
 <JOFFREY BARATHEON> then declares it time for the bedding ceremony which involves the <FIRST MEN> at the wedding stripping the bride and the women stripping the groom before carrying them off to the marriage bed but tyrion angrily insists there will be no bedding ceremony . when <JOFFREY BARATHEON> keeps pushing the matter , tyrion slams his dagger into the table and threatens that <JOFFREY BARATHEON> will be fucking his own bride with a wooden cock if he doesn't let it drop . as the court stands in shocked silence , <JOFFREY BARATHEON> seethes with outrage and tyrion defiantly glares at his nephew with pure hatred . after a tense moment , tywin defuses the situation by agreeing that there will be no bedding ceremony , and placates <JOFFREY BARATHEON> by claiming tyrion's outburst is merely the result of his being extremely drunk . taking the hint , tyrion visibly swallows his anger and begins to act far more drunk than he actually is , intentionally humiliating himself , and says he only made a bad joke . it isn't clear if anyone in the room , including tywin or <JOFFREY BARATHEON> , think that tyrion's outburst was simply due to being very drunk , but everyone plays along anyway to help the tension pass . tyrion , while pretending to be so drunk he can barely stand , escorts sansa to their bedchamber . 
once they are alone in their quarters , a tense moment passes as sansa nervously and slowly undresses . tyrion ultimately tells her to stop , deciding that he will not consummate the marriage if she does not want to , and only will if she changes her mind . when sansa questions what he will do if she never does , tyrion sarcastically jokes and so my watch begins implying that his marriage will be celibate for all time like a brother of the night's watch and then abruptly passes out on a nearby couch . the following morning , <SHAE> notices with a hint of a smile that sansa's bed sheets are not stained with blood and tyrion's virgin bride is still a virgin .

 <SAM> tells <GILLY> about a way to get through the wall . 
 <SAM> tells <GILLY> that they are a considerable distance west of <CASTLE BLACK> , but this isn't a problem , because this means they are close to the <NIGHTFORT> , the original headquarters of the night's watch , which was abandoned centuries ago as the organization's numbers dwindled . <SAM> explains that he plans to get them across the wall using a secret sally port which leads right into the <NIGHTFORT> . <GILLY> is amazed that <SAM> knows so much history just from reading books , insisting that he is a wizard much to <SAM>'s delight and is awestruck when she finally catches a glimpse of the wall . 
meanwhile , <BRAN STARK> and his group have passed far enough north that they have left the <SEVEN KINGDOMS> proper , and entered into the gift a stretch of land <SOUTH> of the wall which was gifted to the night's watch thousands of years ago by brandon the builder , from which the watch draws support for its material needs . the reeds are puzzled , because the gift possesses good arable land but the countryside is empty . <BRAN STARK> explains , to <OSHA>'s discomfort , that wildling attacks coming over or around the wall caused most of the smallfolk to flee the gift over the centuries . meanwhile , the watch's diminishing numbers mean they don't really need that much support from the gift anymore , explaining why they haven't encountered any <BROTHERS> of the watch working the lands either . <BRAN STARK>'s group takes shelter in an abandoned mill to get out of a thunderstorm . 
nearby in the gift , <JON SNOW> and the wildling party encounter an <HOLD> woman who lives alone at a small farm where he breeds horses for the night's watch . they plan to attack him to steal his horses and gold , but <JON SNOW> insists that the <HOLD> woman is no threat to them . <ORELL> and <TORMUND> giantsbane intend to kill the woman so as to stop him from alerting the night's watch to their presence . however , when the party attacks the farmstead , <JON SNOW> surreptitiously hits a rock with his sword , alerting the <HOLD> woman who flees <JON SNOW> also distracts <YGRITTE> when she tries to shoot the fleeing woman with an arrow . while in the mill , <BRAN STARK> and <JOJEN> reed discuss how they plan to cross the wall , before <MEERA> spots the <HOLD> horse breeder riding nearby . after the <HOLD> woman is captured by the <WILDLINGS> , <HODOR> scared by the thunder begins yelling , which threatens to give away their location to the <WILDLINGS> . <BRAN STARK> uses his warg abilities to enter <HODOR>'s mind and cause him to pass out . 
 <SUMMER> attacks a wildling . 
 <OUTSIDE> , <TORMUND> moves to kill the <HOLD> woman , but <ORELL> tells him to have <JON SNOW> do it instead to prove his loyalty . <JON SNOW> is ultimately unable to kill the innocent woman , and instead <YGRITTE> kills the woman with an arrow . realizing that <JON SNOW> is still loyal to the night's watch , <TORMUND> orders his men to kill <JON SNOW> <TORMUND> restrains <YGRITTE> to stop her trying to help <JON SNOW> , and soon after <JON SNOW> battles with <ORELL> . at the urging of <JOJEN> , <BRAN STARK> enters the mind of <SUMMER> , his direwolf , to aid <JON SNOW> . <SUMMER> and <SHAGGYDOG> kill two <WILDLINGS> threatening <JON SNOW> as he battles to the death with <ORELL> and finally kills him . with the last of his strength <ORELL> wargs into the mind of his pet eagle , which swoops down and attacks <JON SNOW> , clawing him badly about the face before he beats the bird off . <JON SNOW> then jumps to mount a nearby horse and escapes , leaving <YGRITTE> and heading back to the wall . . 
 <JON SNOW> kills <ORELL> . 
that night <BRAN STARK> asks <OSHA> to take <RICKON> who would be heir to winterfell if anything were to happen to <BRAN STARK> or robb to last hearth , the <HOME> of <HOUSE UMBER> , while he , <MEERA> and <JOJEN> head through the wall in search of the three eyed raven . <OSHA> promises to look after <RICKON> and orders the reed siblings to do the same with <BRAN STARK> before she , <RICKON> , and <SHAGGYDOG> depart in the dead of night .

 <SANDOR CLEGANE> is horrified by the gruesome spectacle , while he holds <ARYA STARK> , who looks on with a dead stare . the <HOUND> rides away with her , undisturbed thanks to the <HOUSE FREY> banner in his <HAND> . 
in the great hall of the <CASTLE BLACK> the following morning , as servants clean up the pools of blood left by their former <RED WEDDING> guests , lords <WALDER FREY> and <ROOSE BOLTON> gloat over their victory and the rewards their treachery has won them . <WALDER FREY> will become lord of <RIVERRUN> , and the <FREYS> will replace the tullys as the <LANNISTERS>' vassals in the <RIVERLANDS> . <ROOSE BOLTON> has been appointed as the new warden of the north , replacing the <STARKS> though <TYWIN LANNISTER> intends to eventually give the position to a future <TYWIN LANNISTER> heir produced by <TYRION LANNISTER> and <SANSA STARK> . 
 <ROOSE BOLTON> expresses his concern that <BRYNDEN> <HOUSE TULLY> escaped the massacre , but <WALDER FREY> dismisses his worries , pointing out that the <BLACKFISH> and the remaining <HOUSE TULLY> garrison at <RIVERRUN> is alone and outnumbered against the combined strength of the <LANNISTERS> , <BOLTONS> , and <FREYS> , although <ROOSE BOLTON> is still visibly concerned . <ROOSE BOLTON> makes plain his contempt for <ROBB STARK> , considering the late boy king arrogant , politically incompetent , and unwilling to take <ROOSE BOLTON>'s advice and make the hard decisions needed to <TYWIN LANNISTER> . <WALDER FREY> questions <ROOSE BOLTON> if he intends to rule the north from winterfell , and he says that he might move his ruling seat there at some future time , after it is rebuilt . this leads <WALDER FREY> to ask how winterfell ended up a ruin . <ROOSE BOLTON> explains that his bastard son <RAMSAY SNOW> offered <ROBB STARK>'s terms that the <IRONBORN> occupiers would be shown mercy if they handed over <THEON GREYJOY> , but when they did they learned that <RAMSAY SNOW> , in his father's words , has his own way of doing things . 
at the <DREADFORT> , <RAMSAY SNOW> eats his breakfast of a thick sausage , taunting <THEON GREYJOY> about his recent emasculation by pointing to his sewn up and blood stained trousers , and laughing as <THEON GREYJOY> finally begs for death as a release from the nightmare . <RAMSAY SNOW> tells him that he is more valuable alive than dead so the answer must be no . <RAMSAY SNOW> notes that <THEON GREYJOY> reeks , and decides that that shall be his new name <REEK> . <THEON GREYJOY> refuses to acknowledge the name , twice insisting that he is <THEON GREYJOY> , but after <RAMSAY SNOW> beats him , he finally breaks down and says his name is <REEK> . 
on <PYKE> , <BALON GREYJOY> reads a message from lord <ROOSE BOLTON>'s bastard while his daughter <YARA> <BALON GREYJOY> cautiously opens a box crudely carved with the <BALON GREYJOY> kraken . as <RAMSAY SNOW>'s letter explains the box contains <THEON GREYJOY>'s favorite toy . the message bluntly says that the <IRONBORN> have until the full moon to withdraw from the north or receive more bits and pieces of <THEON GREYJOY> . in addition any remaining <IRONBORN> will be flayed alive just as <RAMSAY SNOW> flayed alive <THEON GREYJOY>'s twenty <IRONBORN> followers at winterfell after they surrendered , even though he had promised them safe passage . it was in fact <RAMSAY SNOW> and his soldiers from <HOUSE BOLTON> who burned winterfell to the ground he simply sent false reports for his father <ROOSE BOLTON> to deliver to <ROBB STARK> which claimed that the <IRONBORN> were responsible , as the <BOLTONS> were preparing to betray the <STARKS> months before the <RED WEDDING> . 
 <BALON GREYJOY> acts indifferent to <THEON GREYJOY>'s situation since he defied <BALON GREYJOY>'s orders and <YARA>'s common sense when he stayed at winterfell . furthermore , he can not further the <BALON GREYJOY> line as the contents of the box prove . however , <YARA> does not share her father's attitude toward her last living brother . she announces her intention to take her fastest ship with her fifty best men , sail around <WESTEROS> , besiege the <DREADFORT> , and liberate <THEON GREYJOY> . 
in the <RIVERLANDS> , a despondent <ARYA STARK> and <SANDOR CLEGANE> ride away from the outskirts of the <TWINS> . they pass close to a small group of <WALDER FREY> men , one of whom is bragging about being one of the men who cut off <GREY WIND>'s head and attached it to <ROBB STARK>'s body . <ARYA STARK> approaches them and sweetly asks to warm herself by the fire . she offers the coin given to her by jaqen north'ghar as payment . when the <WALDER FREY> man investigates , she stabs him in the <NECK> . slightly thrown , the <HOUND> deals with the others before demanding to know where <ARYA STARK> got the knife . she reveals it's his . he admonishes her to let him know the next time she plans to do something like that . as he grumbles and cleans up the bodies , <ARYA STARK> whispers , <VALAR MORGHULIS> . 
meanwhile , in king's <LANDING> , <TYRION LANNISTER> and <SANSA STARK> walk through the gardens . a pair of passing gentlemen snigger at <TYRION LANNISTER> , either for his dwarf status or due to rumors he has not consummated his marriage . <SANSA STARK> tells him to pay them no mind . <TYRION LANNISTER> reminds <SANSA STARK> that he's used to it , as he's always been a dwarf . he also states that he's not joffrey , <TYRION LANNISTER> would rather bide his time and humiliate them . <SANSA STARK> playfully follows his line of thinking , and suggests sheep shifting secretly hiding sheep's dung deep within a mattress as <ARYA STARK> used to do to her , so that the target always wakes up smelling of dung . <TYRION LANNISTER> is amused but is confused by the term , though he realizes belatedly that <SANSA STARK> has misheard the word shit . he is rescued from having to explain his wife's mistake by <PODRICK> payne , who calls him to a meeting of the <SMALL COUNCIL> . 
in <TYWIN LANNISTER>'s chambers <GRAND> maester <PYCELLE> dithers over giving <TYRION LANNISTER> a coded message from lord joffrey . joffrey jubilantly explains its meaning that <ROBB STARK> and <CATELYN STARK> are both dead . <TYRION LANNISTER> is visibly startled by the news , already foreseeing the long term problems that the incident will cause , but joffrey brushes him off and gleefully states that he intends to serve <ROBB STARK>'s severed head to <SANSA STARK> at his <RED WEDDING> feast . none of the <SMALL COUNCIL> are able to mask how distasteful they find the concept . <VARYS> points out that <SANSA STARK> is joffrey's aunt by marriage now and it would be unseemly not to give her the basic respect that accords . 
a deeply embarrassed cersei forces a smile and insists to the rest of the <SMALL COUNCIL> that joffrey was only joking and did not mean it . this puzzles joffrey , who matter of factly states to his mother that he did mean it , and he will have <ROBB STARK>'s head served at his <RED WEDDING> feast . <TYRION LANNISTER> flatly forbids it and tells joffrey that <SANSA STARK> isn't his to torment anymore . joffrey angrily proclaims that he is the king , and everyone is his to torment . <TYWIN LANNISTER> counters that a king who has to remind his subjects that he is the king , is no king . joffrey goes apoplectic and tries to fight his grandfather , deriding <TYWIN LANNISTER> as a coward who hid under <CASTERLY ROCK> while joffrey's father king robert won the real war when he overthrew the <TARGARYENS> . the entire <SMALL COUNCIL> tenses waiting for <TYWIN LANNISTER> to respond to this shocking insult instead <TYWIN LANNISTER> coldly and calmly declares that the king is tired and advises the queen regent to see him to bed . joffrey weakly protests that he is not tired but leaves with his mother , and <TYWIN LANNISTER> also asks <PYCELLE> to give his grandson a sedative to make sure he goes to sleep . 
 <TYWIN LANNISTER> dismisses the rest of the <SMALL COUNCIL> , save <TYRION LANNISTER> , who drily notes that the lord of the <SEVEN KINGDOMS> has been sent to bed without his supper . he confronts <TYWIN LANNISTER> about his part in the <RED WEDDING> , and deduces that his father must have orchestrated it , as <WALDER FREY> is not brave enough to have carried it out on his own . the <HAND> blithely confirms this . he dismisses <TYRION LANNISTER>'s concerns that the <NORTHERNERS> will never forget nor forgive such an outrage , arguing he wants them to remember so that it will make them wary of rebelling again . <TYRION LANNISTER> shows his distaste for <TYWIN LANNISTER>'s choice of a <RED WEDDING> as the place to inflict the slaughter , but <TYWIN LANNISTER> responds , asking why killing ten thousand soldiers in <BATTLE> is nobler than killing a dozen guests at a <RED WEDDING> . 
 <TYWIN LANNISTER> again waxes poetic about family , noting <TYRION LANNISTER>'s failure to consummate his marriage to <SANSA STARK> . <TYRION LANNISTER> refuses to force himself on <SANSA STARK> to do his duty , and notes that she is hardly likely to warm to him now that the <LANNISTERS> have murdered her mother and brother . <TYRION LANNISTER> demands to know when <TYWIN LANNISTER> ever put the family's interests above his own . <TYWIN LANNISTER> retorts that he did exactly that on the day that <TYRION LANNISTER> was born he wanted to throw his newborn son into the sea , but instead he spared him and raised him as his son , because he is a <TYRION LANNISTER> . 
immediately after leaving , <TYRION LANNISTER> returns to his chambers and calls for <SANSA STARK> , who simply regards him with a forlorn , tear streaked face confirming that she was already informed of her family's death . <TYRION LANNISTER> backs out , knowing that his sympathy would be rather cold comfort . 
elsewhere in the <RED KEEP> , <VARYS> meets with <SHAE> . he tells her that he knows she is genuinely in love with <TYRION LANNISTER> and that is why she should take the diamonds he offers her and leave immediately for essos to build a new , lavish life for herself . <VARYS> is convinced that <TYRION LANNISTER> is the last hope for the <SEVEN KINGDOMS>' current regime , therefore <SHAE> is a weakness that <TYRION LANNISTER> , and thus the <REALM> , can not afford . <SHAE> confirms that she is in love with <TYRION LANNISTER> and that she cares deeply for <SANSA STARK> as well , but in spite of her pain at seeing them together and the danger she poses , <SHAE> will not leave until or unless <TYRION LANNISTER> asks her to . 
unknown to everyone in king's <LANDING> , <JAIME LANNISTER> , <BRIENNE> of tarth , and <QYBURN> finally arrive the city folk do not even recognize <JAIME LANNISTER> after his long absence from the capital . they make their way to the <RED KEEP> , where <JAIME LANNISTER> immediately calls on cersei , who regards him with a confused look as she takes in his disheveled appearance and missing <HAND> . 
at <DRAGONSTONE> , ser <DAVOS> seaworth tests his new found literacy on <STANNIS BARATHEON>'s correspondence , declining <SHIREEN> <STANNIS BARATHEON>'s invitation to read more tales of <AEGON> i targaryen . he expresses dissatisfaction about the odd spelling of the word night , before hearing the horns that signal <MELISANDRE>'s intents to sacrifice <GENDRY> . he argues with <STANNIS BARATHEON> again about sacrificing the boy , but <STANNIS BARATHEON> is convinced by <MELISANDRE> that using <GENDRY> as part of her blood magic will give him the power to destroy his enemies and claim the <IRON THRONE> . when he doesn't get through to his liege , <DAVOS> takes matters into his own hands and frees the boy , giving him a rowboat and directions to king's <LANDING> . a furious <STANNIS BARATHEON> sentences <DAVOS> to death but the <ONION KNIGHT> produces a letter from the <ONION KNIGHT>'s watch . <DAVOS> insists that it is <STANNIS BARATHEON>' duty to assist the black <BROTHERS> , and that he will need <DAVOS>'s assistance to rally troops and mercenaries . <MELISANDRE> burns the letter and acknowledges the truth the war of the <FIVE KINGS> is irrelevant . the true war lies in the north , and evil and death are marching on the wall . she also agrees that <DAVOS> has an important role to play in the events to come . <STANNIS BARATHEON> sarcastically laughs at r'hllor's sense of humor , noting that the god <DAVOS> likes to mock has chosen him for a higher purpose .

when <JON SNOW> refers to the <WILDLINGS> as <FREE FOLK> , <JANOS SLYNT> accuses him of going native , to the extent he even talks like them . <JON SNOW> snaps back , acknowledging that he talks like a wildling and also admits to living amongst the <WILDLINGS> , eating with them , and climbing the wall with them . he catches himself before admitting that he lay with one , but says it anyway . <JANOS SLYNT> calls for <JON SNOW>'s execution for breaking one of his vows . <AEMON> points out the impracticality of executing every ranger who lays with a girl and says that the wall would be manned by headless men . <ALLISER THORNE> says that there is a difference between sneaking off to a brothel and sleeping with the enemy . 
 <JON SNOW> does not defend himself at this point . instead , he says that <MANCE RAYDER> intends to attack the night's <CITY WATCH> with his <ARMY> of 100 , 000 <WILDLINGS> and gives intelligence on <MANCE RAYDER>'s plan of attack . both <ALLISER THORNE> and <JANOS SLYNT> disbelieve what <JON SNOW> has to say . <AEMON> , however , realizes that <JON SNOW> is speaking the truth , and the hearing ends with <JON SNOW> being allowed to <RED KEEP> his head , although after <JON SNOW> leaves , <ALLISER THORNE> expresses his distrust for <JON SNOW> .

the two eventually come upon a tavern . both hungry , <ARYA STARK> suggests that they attack the men there , to which the <HOUND> expresses reluctance as there are five men . just then , two men exit to relieve themselves . <ARYA STARK> recognizes one of them as <POLLIVER> , the <TYRION LANNISTER> man at arms who had previously taken <ARYA STARK>'s sword <NEEDLE> and killed her friend <LOMMY> . she also notices that <POLLIVER> still has <NEEDLE> and runs off to get it back . the <HOUND> chases after her , stopping her at the tavern's door , but they are seen and choose to go in anyways . 
it is clear that <POLLIVER> and the other men are making trouble and intend to rape the tavern owner's daughter . <ARYA STARK> and the <HOUND> go to a table far away from everyone else , but <POLLIVER> still recognizes the <HOUND> and walks over to their table and strikes up a conversation . he does not recognize <ARYA STARK> , who he thinks is just the <HOUND>'s latest sexual conquest . <POLLIVER> implies that he and his men intend to rape and pillage on their way back to king's <LANDING> and invites the <HOUND> to come along . <POLLIVER> says that he and his men wear the king's colors and can do whatever they like , to which the <HOUND> leans forward and states emphatically , <FUCK> the king . 
the conversation then becomes tense and turns into a standoff . they eventually draw their swords . at first , the <HOUND> fights the five men alone while <ARYA STARK> stands in the corner . he easily dispatches two of them and fights off the rest , stabbing one in the groin . another , however , gets him on the ground , holding a dagger to his throat . the <HOUND> is able to fight him off , stabbing him repeatedly in the head with his own dagger . 
 <ARYA STARK> then joins the fray , smashing a pot over the head of one of the men and stabbing him with his own long sword . she then slashes <POLLIVER>'s leg from behind , causing him to fall to the ground . <ARYA STARK> takes <NEEDLE> from <POLLIVER> and stands over his prone form . she echoes what he had said to <LOMMY> just before he killed him , though <POLLIVER> still doesn't recognize her and has no idea what she is talking about . <ARYA STARK> then repeats what he had said to her when he took <NEEDLE> fine little blade . maybe i'll pick my teeth with it . it is at that point when <POLLIVER> recognizes her and becomes frightened . <ARYA STARK> then kills <POLLIVER> in the same way he had killed <LOMMY> by driving <NEEDLE> slowly into his throat . <ARYA STARK> and the <HOUND> then leave the tavern , taking with them a horse for <ARYA STARK> and a chicken the <HOUND> wanted .

 <ROOSE BOLTON> dispatches <LOCKE> with orders to find and kill bran and <RICKON> <REEK> suggests that <JON SNOW> might either be sheltering the boys at <CASTLE BLACK> or at least may know where they have gone , while <RAMSAY SNOW> advocates killing <JON SNOW> as well , given that the fact he has <ROBB STARK> blood could lead to him becoming a threat , since the northeners will rally behind him or he will simply seek revenge although harming <JON SNOW> would constitute a grave crime since he is part of the night's watch and thus legally untouchable by the <SEVEN KINGDOMS> . <ROOSE BOLTON> gives <RAMSAY SNOW> orders as well to take <THEON GREYJOY> and an <ARMY> to <MOAT CAILIN> and reclaim the fortress from the greyjoys . if he succeeds , <ROOSE BOLTON> will give consideration to legitimizing <RAMSAY SNOW> as a member of <HOUSE BOLTON> . 
b . 
we follow the point of view of a panting figure traveling through a dark , <RAMSAY SNOW> covered <FOREST> . it kills a deer . just as the figure makes its kill , it is revealed that the figure is <SUMMER> and that <BRAN STARK> had been warging into <SUMMER> . <BRAN STARK>'s warging is interrupted by <MEERA> reed , who says that <BRAN STARK> had been gone for hours . <BRAN STARK> is not happy about having been snapped out of his warging , saying that he was eating . <JOJEN> reed clarifies that <SUMMER> was eating and that what <BRAN STARK> can not gain sustenance from what <SUMMER> eats . <JOJEN> and <MEERA> also caution <BRAN STARK> that warging so long is dangerous for other reasons . even though it allows <BRAN STARK> the mobility he lost when he was injured , <BRAN STARK> would become trapped , forgetting his friends , his family , his <HOME> , and even himself . and if <BRAN STARK> forgets himself , they all lose everything . 
the group breaks camp and continues traveling through the <FOREST> . they eventually come upon a <WEIRWOOD> tree . <BRAN STARK> has <HODOR> take him to the tree . <BRAN STARK> touches the tree just under the face carved into it and sees a vision . several images rush to <BRAN STARK>'s mind , including swarms of crows , wights both human and horses , and the fall that paralyzed him . he also sees the three eyed raven taking flight in a darkened corridor and later land on a tree . <BRAN STARK> sees his father sharpening <ICE> , in the <CASTLE BLACK> cells , and being led to his execution the <RED KEEP> abandoned and covered in <RAMSAY SNOW> and the <SHADOW> of a dragon flying over king's <LANDING> . <BRAN STARK> also sees several images of a different <WEIRWOOD> tree located on top of an otherwise barren mountain . during the vision , a gravely voice tells <BRAN STARK> to look for me beneath the tree ... north . <BRAN STARK> snaps out of his vision out of breath , but then matter of factly states , i know where we have to go . . 
a . 
over a meal , jaime and tyrion discuss jaime's gilded steel <HAND> , and he discloses to tyrion that he can no longer fight , as all of his instincts are wrong using his left <HAND> . jaime is perturbed that people will find out that he can not fight so tyrion tells him that he needs to train with his left <HAND> with someone trustworthy in order to better protect the king , as the lord commander of the <KINGSGUARD> . 
 <BRIENNE> presented before king joffrey and queen margaery at their <RED WEDDING> . 
later , jaime waits in a courtyard by the sea for his training partner that tyrion has arranged . bronn emerges with two training swords . jaime remarks that he hasn't wielded a sparring sword since he was nine . as they commence training , bronn uses his usual dirty tactics and gets the better of jaime , teaching him not only to use his offhand , but encouraging him to fight dirtier . 
tyrion finds <VARYS> on his way to a breakfast celebration on the day of joffrey's <RED WEDDING> . <VARYS> divulges that <SHAE> has been spotted and that his sister , cersei , has been notified . <VARYS> then says that there is nothing he can do to protect <SHAE> any longer in fear of <TYWIN LANNISTER> , the <HAND> of the king , or cersei finding out that he has been lying to them . tyrion then says that <SHAE> will not leave king's <LANDING> and is warned that <TYWIN LANNISTER> has threatened to hang the next whore tyrion is seen with . 
the dais set up for the royal <RED WEDDING> . 
at the breakfast celebration , <MACE> tyrell gifts joffrey a magnificent golden chalice with <SEVEN KINGDOMS> facets , one for each of the major houses in the <SEVEN KINGDOMS> and wishes he and his daughter , <MARGAERY TYRELL> , a long and happy marriage . joffrey graciously accepts . cersei spots <SHAE> and tells <TYWIN LANNISTER> that she is tyrion's whore , and he commands for her to be sent to the tower of the <HAND> before the <RED WEDDING> . tyrion overhears this and looks vexed , but proceeds to approach joffrey and <PODRICK> payne , tyrion's squire , presents him with the lives of four kings , a book detailing the reigns of four kings by <GRAND> maester kaeth . joffrey accepts the gift but his sincerity seems questionable . a member of the <KINGSGUARD> then presents a <VALYRIAN> steel sword and <TYWIN LANNISTER> tells him that it is one of <TWO SWORDS> of its kind in the capital , and joffrey rushes to wield it . he promptly begins to slash at tyrion's gift despite its rarity , and then asks for suggestions on its name from guests in attendance . he settle on the name widow's wail . 
after the breakfast , tyrion is visited in his chambers by <SHAE> and he informs her that there is a ship waiting for her bound for <PENTOS> and that their friendship is at an end . <SHAE> pleads to stay , but tyrion says he is married and it is too dangerous for her to stay . . 
joffrey is poisoned and killed . 
when bronn enters and tries to escort her out , she slaps him and runs away . when tyrion later asks bronn if she is gone , he says that she boarded the ship . when tyrion asks if he saw it sail away , bronn assures him that no one has been following him while escorting her , that she is gone and no one knows about it except the <TWO SWORDS> of them and <VARYS> . he then advises tyrion to go and drink until it feels like he did the right thing . 
joffrey and <MARGAERY TYRELL>'s <RED WEDDING> ceremony takes place in the great sept of baelor conducted by the <HIGH SEPTON> and they are wed in front of gods and men . at his <RED WEDDING> feast , king joffrey speaks to the crowd about contemplating history . out of a large golden lion , five dwarves ride out , representing joffrey , <RENLY> baratheon , <STANNIS BARATHEON> , <ROBB STARK> , and <BALON GREYJOY> , each of the <FIVE KINGS> in the war of the <FIVE KINGS> . the dwarves put on a performance , jousting , fighting , and making crude sexual acts . joffrey , his brother <TOMMEN> , and cersei laugh at the performance . the <TYRELLS> <MARGAERY TYRELL> , olenna , <MACE> , and <LORAS> , as well as <VARYS> , prince <OBERYN> , <TYWIN LANNISTER> , tyrion , and <SANSA STARK> , make little effort to hide their disgust . <LORAS> leaves in anger after watching the crude depiction of his deceased lover <RENLY> riding a mount resembling <LORAS> , and <SANSA STARK> looks on in obvious grief when the dwarf playing her brother <ROBB STARK> is killed after having his wolf's head knocked off . joffrey expresses his delight with the play and prepares to give the champion dwarf a purse but then mockingly suggests that tyrion fight him as well . tyrion cleverly counters this jape by suggesting that joffrey should fight instead and show the same bravery he displayed at the <BATTLE> of the <BLACKWATER> , cautioning his nephew to be careful as the champion dwarf is clearly <MAD> with lust and it would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his <RED WEDDING> night . this draws a few stifled chuckles from their guests . enraged and humiliated that his uncle outwitted him in front of all his <RED WEDDING> guests , joffrey petulantly pours wine over tyrion's head and orders him to serve him wine as his cupbearer . 
tyrion approaches joffrey , who then purposely drops the goblet and kicks it under the table . <SANSA STARK> hands the goblet to tyrion , and he fills it with wine and hands it back to joffrey . the king demands that tyrion kneel before him but tyrion refuses . <MARGAERY TYRELL> interrupts the tense moment and says it is time to cut the pigeon pie . joffrey hands the goblet to <MARGAERY TYRELL> , who then places it at the edge of the table near her grandmother olenna . joffrey draws his new sword , cuts the pie , and several white doves fly out . 
cersei cries over her sons murder . 
 <SANSA STARK> and tyrion attempt to leave the feast , while <MARGAERY TYRELL> serves joffrey a piece of pie . joffrey commands tyrion to serve him wine to wash down the pie . tyrion hands the goblet to joffrey and he quickly drinks all of it . joffrey tries to speak , but begins coughing . he grabs his throat , and <MARGAERY TYRELL> and olenna exclaim that he is choking and needs help . joffrey collapses face down and begins vomiting and convulsing . jaime and cersei rush in and turn joffrey over on his back . <DONTOS> hollard suddenly approaches <SANSA STARK> from behind and says she must come with him quickly , and she does . joffrey points an accusatory finger in tyrion's direction , as he examines the wine goblet though it is not made clear if joffrey is accusing tyrion or merely the wine . joffrey's eyes turn <RED WEDDING> , blood runs from his nose , he stops convulsing , and dies . cersei sobs with grief and orders the <KINGSGUARD> to seize tyrion for the poisoning of her son .

on the road to the <EYRIE> , <SANDOR CLEGANE> and <ARYA STARK> continue to spar verbally and physically , particularly when <SANDOR CLEGANE> disparages <ARYA STARK>'s <BLACKWATER> dancing and insults <SYRIO FOREL> for being overcome by a glorified thug like <MERYN TRANT> .

in <DANY>'s audience chamber , <GREY WORM> comes to apologize to <MISSANDEI> , but she tells him he doesn't need to . he hopes he didn't frighten her , and she says he did not . addressing her in the common tongue , he tells her the lessons she gives are precious to him . gently correcting his vocabulary , she notes that she doesn't remember teaching him the word precious . <GREY WORM> tells her that jorah taught it to him . she asks whether he remembers his birth name , and <GREY WORM> says he remembers nothing . she asks if he remembers when they cut him , and he shakes his head no . she tells him she's sorry they did that to him , and when <GREY WORM> asks her why , she says it's a terrible thing to do to a boy . <GREY WORM> counters that , had the masters not cut him , he never would have been unsullied , he never would have been freed , chosen to lead them , and met her . <MISSANDEI> is visibly moved by this . <GREY WORM> apologizes once again , and she stops him while he turns to leave , telling him she is glad he saw her . he tells her he's glad as well .

later , baelish visits sansa and asks why she lied on his behalf . sansa explains that she has no idea what <ROYCE> , <CORBRAY> , and <WAYNWOOD> would want from her if he were eliminated , but that she does know what it is he wants . <LITTLEFINGER> seems impressed that she made such a calculating decision , but attempts to cast doubt on her certainty , by asking if she really knows what he wants . later on , as <LITTLEFINGER> and <ROBIN> prepare to depart on a tour of the <VALE> , a raven haired sansa accompanies them , in a feathered <CASTLE BLACK> dress with a plunging neckline .

a . 
in the last hours before his trial by combat , tyrion and jaime share a final drink in tyrion's cell and reminisce about <ORSON> <TYWIN LANNISTER> , their simple minded cousin who spent his days smashing beetles with a rock . tyrion tells jaime of how he used to observe <ORSON> day after day in an attempt to understand his motives , but in the end he was never able to come to reach any understanding . tyrion asks jaime if he thinks <OBERYN> stands a chance , but jaime is not optimistic . as a bell rings out to announce daybreak in the city , jaime takes his leave , wishing his brother luck . 
 <TYWIN LANNISTER> guardsmen escort tyrion to the arena , where a large crowd has assembled . he grows apprehensive to find a helm less <OBERYN> drinking , and wearing very <LIGHT> armor in comparison to his opponent , ser <GREGOR CLEGANE> , clad from head to foot in heavy armor and wielding a greatsword . <OBERYN> dismisses tyrion's concerns , noting that he always drinks before a fight and favors speed over protection . as <GREGOR CLEGANE> and his squire make their way to the arena , ellaria becomes concerned , noting that the mountain is the biggest woman she's ever seen , but <OBERYN> remains confident that he will emerge triumphant . <GRAND> maester <PYCELLE> steps into the arena and begins making a long winded speech asking the gods to favor the innocent before <TYWIN LANNISTER> cuts him short and begins the trial by combat . 
 <OBERYN> , after impressing the crowd with a display of acrobatic spear maneuvers , goes on the attack , stabbing out at <GREGOR CLEGANE> and constantly moving out of the knight's reach , forcing <GREGOR CLEGANE> to tire himself out chasing his opponent . as he evades <GREGOR CLEGANE> , <OBERYN> repeatedly taunts <GREGOR CLEGANE> by constantly bringing up his part in the murder of his sister , <ELIA> martell , and her children , and demanding a confession , only enraging <GREGOR CLEGANE> further . as the fight progresses , <OBERYN> manages to seriously injure <GREGOR CLEGANE> , stabbing him first in the chest , severing his hamstring and then burying his spear in <GREGOR CLEGANE>'s stomach , pinning him to the floor . as jaime and tyrion exchange a relieved grin across the arena , a furious <OBERYN> circles the prone <GREGOR CLEGANE> , demanding that before he dies , <GREGOR CLEGANE> confess to murdering <ELIA> and her children , raping <ELIA> , and that it was <TYWIN LANNISTER> who gave the order . 
however , <OBERYN> stands too close to his seemingly defeated opponent , and <GREGOR CLEGANE> manages to trip and seize him . berserk with fury , <GREGOR CLEGANE> grabs <OBERYN> by the throat and lifts him off the ground , smashing out most of his teeth with a single devastating punch . climbing on top of <OBERYN> , <GREGOR CLEGANE> finally admits for all to hear that he raped and killed <ELIA> as he gouges out <OBERYN>'s eyes with his thumbs before crushing the viper's skull between his hands , which he proclaims having done the same to his sister . as ellaria screams in horror , a stunned silence sweeps over the crowd . the short joyful moments for tyrion and jaime are shattered , as <TYWIN LANNISTER> stands and proclaims the will of the gods is clear tyrion is guilty and sentenced to death . tyrion can not even reply , shockingly staring in catatonic astonishment at <OBERYN>'s skull crushed corpse , as does jaime the only different reaction is from cersei , who stares at <OBERYN>'s slaughtered body , listening to tyrion's death sentence while smirking in vindication .

jon and <SAM> are standing watch atop the wall , staring out into the darkness of the north and awaiting the imminent wildling invasion . <SAM> attempts to interrogate jon about what it was like to be with a woman , stating that as their deaths are likely imminent , it may be his last chance to find out . <SAM> brings up that the vows of the knight's watch only explicitly forbid members from taking wives or producing children , and that other activities are open to interpretation . jon replies glumly that <ALLISER THORNE> most likely does not care about their interpretations . when further pressed by <SAM> to describe lying down with <YGRITTE> , jon attempts to explain but is unable to properly express it , proclaiming exasperatedly that he's not a bleeding poet . 
jon offers to take the watch up alone so <SAM> can go below , and as <SAM> steps into the elevator and begins to descend the wall , an owl lands on top of the wall and begins hooting loudly . the owl is revealed to be controlled by a <THENN> warg who is a member of the garrison of <WILDLINGS> under command of <TORMUND> and <STYR> , who have set up camp just <OUTSIDE> of the southern entrance to <CASTLE BLACK> . <TORMUND> boasts about a bear he supposedly had sex with , prompting <YGRITTE> to cut him short and cast her doubts on the validity of his claim . she tells him that she only cares about getting as many arrows through the hearts of crows as possible . she angrily talks about how the people <SOUTH> of the wall shut the the <WILDLINGS> out by building it and hunting the <WILDLINGS> as enemies she says that now the <WILDLINGS> are the hunters and the southerners their prey . <STYR> mockingly replies that <YGRITTE> has more words about killing than she has arrows . she defends herself by saying she killed just as many people at <MOLE>'s <TOWN> as he , but <STYR> replies that none of them was her former lover . he further mocks her by saying that when she sees him , she'll likely just serve him a slice of ginger minge , causing her to jump to her feet in anger . <YGRITTE> stares <STYR> down , claiming that she wants to kill <JON SNOW> herself , then looks around the camp and warns the others that she has an arrow ready for anyone else who attempts to kill him . just <OUTSIDE> the camp , a shaded person cradling something passes by the <WILDLINGS> unnoticed . 
maester <AEMON> finds <SAM> in the <CASTLE BLACK> library . meanwhile , <SAM> is caught reading a book about <WILDLINGS> by maester <AEMON> . <AEMON> correctly guesses that <SAM> is reading the book because he wants to know what kind of fate might have befallen <GILLY> if she fell into wildling hands during the <SACK> of <MOLE>'s <TOWN> . he also surmises that <SAM> has shown such a keen interest in her fate because he is in love with her , despite <SAM>'s protests to the contrary . <AEMON> muses about the girl he once loved , stating that he can still picture her as clear as day and that she is more real than <SAM> is . after being dismissed by <AEMON> , <SAM> leaves the maester's chambers only to hear <GILLY> at the gate begging to be allowed inside , revealing her survival of the <MOLE>'s <TOWN> massacre and her identity as the cloaked figure approaching <CASTLE BLACK> . <PYPAR> attempts to deny her passage into the <CASTLE BLACK> , saying he is not allowed to open the gate under any circumstances . however , <SAM> roars at <PYP> to allow her in , causing <PYP> to relent and let her in . <SAM> promises <GILLY> wherever she goes next he will go too , but their reunion is cut short by two blows from the horn , indicating that mance's wildling <ARMY> has finally begun their assault . <SAM> rushes to get <GILLY> safely inside the <CASTLE BLACK> while other <BROTHERS> of the knight's watch prepare for the imminent attack by <WILDLINGS> . 
 <JON SNOW> looking off the top of the wall . 
on top of the wall , <JON SNOW> hears the horn blowing and looks north , witnessing a tremendous conflagration to the north , just as mance had promised . <SOUTH> of the wall , the <THENN> warg's owl also spots the fire and informs <STYR> and <TORMUND> that the time has come to attack <CASTLE BLACK> . <JON SNOW> approaches ser <ALLISER THORNE> , who finally relents and admits that they should have heeded <JON SNOW>'s advice and blocked the gates . he grimly muses that leadership often means being second guessed by every clever little twat with a mouth and when a woman in charge second guesses himself , all is doomed . steeling himself for the impending <SIEGE> , <ALLISER THORNE> begins barking orders to the archers , preparing them to fire upon the attackers massing below . 
 <SAM> and <GILLY> share a kiss . <SAM> brings <GILLY> and her baby to a storage room where she can hide . <GILLY> wants <SAM> to stay with her as he promised , but he can not as he swore to defend the wall as a brother of the knight's watch . before he leaves her , <GILLY> begs <SAM> to promise her that he won't die and the two finally share a kiss . as <SAM> and <PYPAR> are preparing arrows at the southern gate , <PYPAR> laments that he has never seen a real <BATTLE> before or ever even held an edged blade . <PYPAR> asks how <SAM> is not afraid , but <SAM> replies that he is , as there are thousands of <WILDLINGS> about to overrun them . <PYPAR> asks how he managed to kill a white walker while being afraid , and <SAM> says that at that moment , he just had to do something or <GILLY> would have been killed and her baby would have been taken . <SAM> further explains that at that moment , he wasn't himself he was nothing , and when you are nothing there is nothing to be afraid of . however , he explains the reason he is afraid now is because i'm not nothing anymore . 
. 
meanwhile , <YGRITTE> spies on the <CASTLE BLACK> to scout numbers of defenders . she tells the other <WILDLINGS> that most of the guards are at the top of the wall and that few are left in the <CASTLE BLACK> . the group immediately take off towards <CASTLE BLACK>'s southern gate , while <YGRITTE> seems to have second thoughts . north of the wall , the massive wildling <ARMY> emerges from the woods , their numbers including giants riding atop mammoths . <ALLISER THORNE> orders the archers on the wall to nock their arrows , but they draw instead while <GRENN> accidentally drops a barrel down the wall . <ALLISER THORNE> angrily drills his men on properly following orders when another horn blows from down below at <CASTLE BLACK> , signalling the unanticipated appearance of <TORMUND>'s band of <WILDLINGS> at the <CASTLE BLACK>'s southern entrance . realizing the dire need for experienced men to defend the keep from the surprise attack , <ALLISER THORNE> orders <JANOS SLYNT> to assume command of the wall's defenses and heads below to join the melee . 
below , <TORMUND> and <STYR>'s forces charge the gate while <YGRITTE> , acting as a sniper , manages to pick off several men defending the gate with her bow . <PYPAR> is firing a crossbow as <SAM> assists by reloading another crossbow , but <PYPAR>'s aim is poor due to inexperience and nerves and he repeatedly misses his shots . the band of <WILDLINGS> manage to reach <CASTLE BLACK>'s walls and begin scaling them using grappling hooks and ropes , forcing <SAM> and <PYP> to retreat . 
 <ALLISER THORNE> arrives with reinforcements from the top of the wall via the wooden lift system , which is being operated by <OLLY> . <ALLISER THORNE> gives an impassioned speech , promising that the ancient order of the knight's watch and <CASTLE BLACK> will survive this <BATTLE> . his speech rallies the <CASTLE BLACK> <BROTHERS> and <ALLISER THORNE> personally leads the charge against the <WILDLINGS> who have breached <CASTLE BLACK>'s defenses , causing an intense <BATTLE> to erupt in the courtyard . 
on the <NORTHERN> side of the wall , a wildling strike force led by two giants one of which is riding a mammoth charge towards <CASTLE BLACK>'s outer gate . on top of the wall , <JANOS SLYNT> , having no true leadership experience , breaks down at the <SIGHT> of the massive wildling <ARMY> and begins fumbling his orders . <GRENN> steps in by falsely claiming that <ALLISER THORNE> needs <JANOS SLYNT> back down below . <JANOS SLYNT> believes the lie and leaves , allowing <JON SNOW> to take command of the wall's defenses . the <CASTLE BLACK> <BROTHERS> continue to rain down arrows on the advancing <WILDLINGS> , even killing ones that are attempting to scale the wall . one giant , armed with a massive bow , manages to fire a huge arrow at one of the bunkers atop the wall , completely obliterating it and killing the <CASTLE BLACK> brother manning it the force of the giant's arrow carries the <CASTLE BLACK> brother off the wall on to the other side where he is shoved into ground with a tremendous amount of force . 
 <HOBB> takes up his butcher's knife to defend the dining hall . 
down in <CASTLE BLACK> , the <BATTLE> rages on between the <WILDLINGS> and the knight's watch . <STYR> and <YGRITTE> continue to slay numerous <CASTLE BLACK> <BROTHERS> . at one point , a group of <WILDLINGS> breach <CASTLE BLACK>'s dining hall . one wildling is killed when a <CASTLE BLACK> brother throws boiling stew in his face and beats him to death with the pot . <HOBB> , <CASTLE BLACK>'s cook , calmly enters the dining hall and kills a wildling with his massive butcher's knife . meanwhile , <JANOS SLYNT> cowardly retreats to a storage room where he discovers <GILLY> and her baby .

 <MAG> mar tun doh weg charges <CASTLE BLACK>'s inner gate . 
the <CASTLE BLACK> <BROTHERS> defending the wall manage to repel most of the <WILDLINGS> attacking the outer gate , but one giant manages to make it through , greatly weakening the gate by repeatedly smashing it with his fists and managing to singlehandedly begin lifting the gate . <JON SNOW> , knowing the inner gate won't <HOLD> against the massive giant , sends a group of <CASTLE BLACK> <BROTHERS> led by <GRENN> to <HOLD> it at any cost . arriving at the inner gate , hill cowers when faced by the giant charging at them , but <GRENN> bolsters his and the others courage by reciting the knight's watch oath . the <CASTLE BLACK> <BROTHERS> ready their weapons just as the giant slams himself into the inner gate . 
. 
 <SAM> arrives atop the wall to ask <JON SNOW> for more men to defend the <CASTLE BLACK> , and <JON SNOW> tasks <SAM> with releasing ghost from his pen to assist in the fighting . <JON SNOW> descends the wall and finally enters the fray , quickly dispatching several <WILDLINGS> and catching the attention of <STYR> the two meet in a single combat . <STYR> eventually gets the upper <HAND> by knocking <LONGCLAW> away and brutally assaulting <JON SNOW> , smashing his face into an anvil and tossing him into the blacksmith's forge . <STYR> picks <JON SNOW> up and begins strangling him , but <JON SNOW> spits blood in <STYR>'s face and distracts him long enough for <JON SNOW> to grab the blacksmith's hammer lying next to him and buries it in <STYR>'s skull . 
 <JON SNOW> holds a dying <YGRITTE> . upon killing <STYR> , <JON SNOW> turns around to find <YGRITTE> pointing her bow at him with an arrow drawn . he smiles at her , causing <YGRITTE> to hesitate . before either can say anything , <YGRITTE> is shot near the heart by an arrow fired from <OLLY> , avenging the death of his father at <YGRITTE>'s hands during the wildling attack on his village . <JON SNOW> holds her in his arms as she tells him that they should have never left the cave , and they lament circumstances that prevented them from being together as she succumbs to her wound . 
 <TORMUND> makes a last stand before he is subdued by <JON SNOW> and the knight's watch . atop the wall , <EDDISON> tollett , who <JON SNOW> left in command of the defenses , orders the men to drop the'scythe.' a huge section of <ICE> suddenly falls away from the wall revealing a massive anchor like blade attached to a chain that swings along the wall , mowing through the <WILDLINGS> attempting to climb its face . <EDDISON> notices the wildling forces are beginning to withdraw into the haunted <FOREST> , proclaiming that they have stopped them for now , but that the <WILDLINGS> still outnumber the <CASTLE BLACK> <BROTHERS> 1 , 000 to 1 and that mance was simply testing their defenses . below , a heavily wounded <TORMUND> is surrounded in the courtyard but continues to fight despite being the only wildling alive in <CASTLE BLACK> . he is finally subdued by <JON SNOW> with a crossbow and taken prisoner by the knight's watch for interrogation . <SAM> returns to <GILLY> just like he promised and discovers <JANOS SLYNT> , who hid in fear during the entire <BATTLE> . against all odds , the knight's watch have repelled <MANCE RAYDER>'s forces for the time being . 
the following morning , what is left of <CASTLE BLACK>'s garrison begin to regroup and prepare for the inevitable next attack by <MANCE RAYDER> . <JON SNOW> discusses with <SAM> that he has a suicidal solution to end the wildling threat he plans to assassinate <MANCE RAYDER> , noting that he is the only thing binding the disparate wildling clans that make up the <ARMY> , and his death will rob them of that purpose and leadership . <SAM> tries to talk sense into <JON SNOW> , but to no avail . as <JON SNOW> prepares to leave via <CASTLE BLACK>'s tunnel , they discover the bodies of the <CASTLE BLACK> <BROTHERS> who held the inner gate against the giant . <GRENN> is amongst the casualties and <JON SNOW> tells <SAM> that all bodies must be burned . before <JON SNOW> leaves , he remembers the promise he made to <JEOR MORMONT> and decides to leave <LONGCLAW> with <SAM> . <SAM> tells <JON SNOW> to come back , and <JON SNOW> looks at <SAM> and smiles unreassuringly before stepping out into the wilderness on the other side of the gate . 
the watchers on the wall is the ninth episode of the fourth season of game of thrones 1 . it is the thirty ninth episode of the series overall . it premiered on june 8 , 2014. it was written by producers david benioff and d.b . <WEISS> and directed by neil marshall . 
the knight's watch , although hopelessly outnumbered , attempts to defend <CASTLE BLACK> from <MANCE RAYDER>'s massive wildling <ARMY> , who plan to <SIEGE> the fortress from the north . meanwhile , a secret garrison of <WILDLINGS> including <TORMUND> , <STYR> , and <YGRITTE> are poised to launch a surprise attack from the <SOUTH> of the wall . 

 <JON SNOW> emerges from the outer gate of the wall and begins trudging north through the aftermath of the previous knight's <BATTLE> towards <MANCE RAYDER>'s war camp . <JON SNOW> eventually reaches the tree line and is quickly surrounded by <WILDLINGS> , who bring him before <MANCE RAYDER> , who notes that he is wearing the <CASTLE BLACK> of the knight's watch again . <MANCE RAYDER> brings <JON SNOW> inside his tent , and questions his status as a traitor . <JON SNOW> confesses that his time spent with the <WILDLINGS> was all part of a plan orchestrated by <QHORIN> <HALFHAND> to get <JON SNOW> to infiltrate <MANCE RAYDER>'s <ARMY> , and that <QHORIN> tricked <MANCE RAYDER> into trusting <JON SNOW> by allowing <JON SNOW> to kill <QHORIN> himself in a fight . <MANCE RAYDER> asks about <YGRITTE> and <JON SNOW> reveals that she died at the <BATTLE> of <CASTLE BLACK> , though not by his hands . saddened , <MANCE RAYDER> proposes that they drink a toast to her memory , but <JON SNOW> is hesitant when given an unfamiliar drink . <JON SNOW> accepts after <MANCE RAYDER> assures him that if he'd wanted to kill <JON SNOW> , poison would be the last of his methods . <MANCE RAYDER> then asks about the giant who got through the gate but never came out , and <JON SNOW> informs <MANCE RAYDER> that the giant perished attempting to breach the inner gate at the hands of his friend <GRENN> . <MANCE RAYDER> ruefully notes that the giant was named <MAG> the mighty , and he was king of the giants , the last of a bloodline stretching back thousands of years before the <FIRST MEN> entered <WESTEROS> , to which <JON SNOW> then glibly notes that his friend <GRENN> was from a farm . they have another toast to <MAG> and <GRENN> . 
 <JON SNOW> then proposes his terms to <MANCE RAYDER> mance is to turn his <ARMY> around and return <HOME> . <MANCE RAYDER> immediately counters that the knight's watch is low on oil , arrows , and <FIRST MEN> , and when he sent his full force against the wall the knight's watch threw everything they had at him to repel the attack . <MANCE RAYDER> guesses there are no more than 50 <FIRST MEN> left guarding <CASTLE BLACK> , but <JON SNOW> lies and insists that there are still over 1 , 000 <FIRST MEN> defending the garrison . however , <MANCE RAYDER> calls <JON SNOW>'s bluff and reveals that after seeing how few <FIRST MEN> were defending <CASTLE BLACK> , he sent 400 <FIRST MEN> about five miles west to climb an unmanned section of the wall , and they will attack <CASTLE BLACK>'s weak southern side as soon as he gives the order . <MANCE RAYDER> then changes his demeanor and reveals that his people have suffered enough bloodshed and that he has no intention of conquering the lands <SOUTH> of the wall that the <WILDLINGS> are moving <SOUTH> to seek refuge from the growing threat of the <WHITE WALKERS> just as those <SOUTH> of the wall are . <MANCE RAYDER> then makes his counteroffer if the knight's watch will open the gates to the <WILDLINGS> and allow them to pass through the wall , no more harm will come to the <CASTLE BLACK> <BROTHERS> . however , if his terms are refused , his wildling <ARMY> will slaughter every last member of the knight's watch and move <SOUTH> by force . 
 <MANCE RAYDER> then notices that <JON SNOW> is eyeing a cooking knife , and quickly deduces that <JON SNOW> came to parley with <MANCE RAYDER> simply so he could assassinate him . he notes that at that moment his personal guards are far enough across the room that <JON SNOW> might actually be able to kill him before being cut down himself , but that <JON SNOW> must have known he would die assassinating <MANCE RAYDER> . <MANCE RAYDER> is shocked and questions <JON SNOW> if this is what the knight's watch has sunk to killing a man who let him into his own tent , accepting a parley in good faith , who shared food and drink with him , and who even offered him relatively reasonable peace terms . <JON SNOW> hesitates , but before anyone can make a move , war horns are heard from <OUTSIDE> . <MANCE RAYDER>'s guards safely grab <JON SNOW> during the distraction , and <MANCE RAYDER> demands to know if the knight's watch is attacking them , but <JON SNOW> admits that it's just as <MANCE RAYDER> said the knight's watch doesn't have remotely enough numbers to leave the safety of the wall and attack . 
columns of heavy horse carrying hundreds of mounted cavalry charge into the wildling camp carrying the flaming stag banners of <HOUSE BARATHEON> of <DRAGONSTONE> , and are led by none other than <STANNIS BARATHEON> and <DAVOS> seaworth . the <WILDLINGS> are caught in their own camp , resting from the <BATTLE> the knight before and only expecting attacks from the wall , so their eastern flank is completely undefended . as they are undisciplined and have no experience fighting heavily armored cavalry , they are quickly dispatched by <STANNIS BARATHEON>' riders , who attack the wildling camp from both sides in two separate columns that catch the <WILDLINGS> in a perfect double envelopment . quickly cutting the wildling forces down , <STANNIS BARATHEON> and <DAVOS> ride up to <MANCE RAYDER> , who throws down his weapons in surrender , officially ending the <WILDLINGS>' <SIEGE> of <CASTLE BLACK> . 
 <DAVOS> introduces <STANNIS BARATHEON> as the true king of the <SEVEN KINGDOMS> , but <MANCE RAYDER> wryly points out that they are not currently in the <SEVEN KINGDOMS> . <STANNIS BARATHEON> demands that it is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king . resignedly , <MANCE RAYDER> says that the <FREE FOLK> do not kneel , knowing that <STANNIS BARATHEON> will kill him if he does not . <DAVOS> , however , asks what a man of the knight's watch is doing in the camp , and <JON SNOW> explains that he came to treaty with the king <BEYOND> the wall . <JON SNOW> says that he knows that <STANNIS BARATHEON> is the true king , as his own father died supporting his claim , revealing himself as the bastard son of <EDDARD STARK> . this makes <STANNIS BARATHEON> regard <JON SNOW> more seriously . <STANNIS BARATHEON> proclaims that <EDDARD STARK> was an honorable man , and asks <JON SNOW> what ned would have done with <MANCE RAYDER> . <JON SNOW> responds that <MANCE RAYDER> could have killed him or tortured him when he was his captive but instead he spared his life , so instead of killing <MANCE RAYDER> he should be taken prisoner and interrogated . before they leave the wildling camp , <JON SNOW> also urges <STANNIS BARATHEON> to burn the dead before nightfall . . 
 <MELISANDRE> looks through the flames , and sees <JON SNOW> . 
back at <CASTLE BLACK> , a funeral is held for the slain members of the knight's watch , who have been arranged in a huge funeral pyre in the <CASTLE BLACK> courtyard . maester <AEMON> delivers a eulogy , saying that they died to protect the <FIRST MEN> , women , and children of the <SOUTH> who will never even know who they were , that it is the duty of the surviving <CASTLE BLACK> <BROTHERS> to keep alive their memory . <AEMON> closes his speech with the customary line , and now their watch has ended , which is repeated by the gathered <FIRST MEN> . samwell then aids <AEMON> in setting the pyre alight , which is continued by <JON SNOW> and other <FIRST MEN> carrying torches . <STANNIS BARATHEON> and <DAVOS> look on , along with queen <SELYSE> and princess <SHIREEN> . <JON SNOW> looks across the flames and catches the gaze of <MELISANDRE> , who is standing on the opposite side of the pyre . <MELISANDRE> seems intrigued , her piercing stare clearly making <JON SNOW> uneasy . 
afterwards , <JON SNOW> enters the chamber of the <CASTLE BLACK> where <TORMUND> is being held . <TORMUND> asks why blind old maester <AEMON> patched up his arrow wounds , and <JON SNOW> says that <AEMON> is sworn to heal all wounded <FIRST MEN> , friend or foe . <TORMUND> asks if <JON SNOW> really loved <YGRITTE> . <JON SNOW> doesn't respond . <TORMUND> says that <YGRITTE> truly loved him , and that he knew because although she never admitted it , she talked only of killing him , revealing her true feelings for him if she hadn't loved him , she wouldn't have been so angered by his betrayal . saddened , <TORMUND> implores <JON SNOW> that <YGRITTE>'s final resting place should be in the real north . <JON SNOW> then takes <YGRITTE>'s corpse to the north side of the wall and builds a funeral pyre for her near a sacred heart tree . <JON SNOW> looks at his lover one last time and lights her pyre , and weeps silently as he turns his back and heads <HOME> . 
far to the north , <BRAN STARK> and the reed children continue their journey to find the three eyed raven , though they are on the brink of exhaustion . <JOJEN> reed has grown sick and and he is barely able to stand , eventually collapsing into the <JON SNOW> . as <MEERA> begs <JOJEN> to gather what little strength he can muster to continue forward , <BRAN STARK> calls out to them , revealing that they have found the massive heart tree that <BRAN STARK> has seen in his visions . as they approach the tree , wights burst up from the <JON SNOW> , grabbing <JOJEN>'s ankles and attempting to drag him under the <ICE> . these wights appear far older than those seen near the wall , appearing as ghastly skeletal warriors who move with surprising agility . <MEERA> attempts to defend <JOJEN> from the wights , but they begin to swarm over <HODOR> , who is too scared to fight back . <BRAN STARK> wargs into <HODOR>'s mind and begins fighting off the wights with the aid of his direwolf <SUMMER> , but more wights keep bursting through the <ICE> and they are quickly overwhelmed . 
just as all seems lost , the wights around <BRAN STARK> suddenly burst into fireballs , and he hears a young girl's voice calling to him from a cave entrance at the base of the heart tree . amidst the confusion <JOJEN> is repeatedly stabbed by a wight before <MEERA> can fight it off . the mysterious girl calls to <MEERA> and says that <JOJEN> is lost and that she must leave him if she wants to live . <MEERA> hesitates , but <JOJEN> urges her to save herself . crying , <MEERA> slits her brother's throat to grant him the mercy of a quick death . <MEERA> runs to the cave entrance along with <BRAN STARK> , <HODOR> , and <SUMMER> while the mysterious child covers their retreat by magically throwing fireballs from her hands at the wights . just as the life drains from <JOJEN>'s eyes , she launches a fireball at his body , immolating his corpse and preventing his return as a wight and fulfilling <JOJEN>'s vision that his death would involve fire . 
they run into the cave , pursued by the wights , who instantly shatter upon crossing the threshold of the cave . the little girl explains that the power which animates the dead corpses is powerless inside the cave . when <BRAN STARK> asks who she is , she replies that the <FIRST MEN> called us'the children , but we were born long before them . <BRAN STARK> realizes that she is one of the last surviving members of the children of the <FOREST> , the original , non human inhabitants of <WESTEROS> who carved the faces into <WEIRWOOD> trees and taught the <FIRST MEN> to worship the old gods thousands of years ago . 
the child leads them deeper into the cave , which is overgrown with white <WEIRWOOD> roots from the massive tree above . other children of the <FOREST> peek out around corners as they advance . finally , they arrive at a large central chamber , its floor littered with bones . in the middle of the cave is an old man seated in the middle of <WEIRWOOD> roots , which have grown around and even through much of his body . <HODOR> places <BRAN STARK> on the ground and <BRAN STARK> crawls towards the old man , asking if he is the three eyed raven who appeared in his visions . the old man admits that he is , having taken several forms in the past , but his true form is before them now . <MEERA> is upset that her brother died to reach him , but the three eyed raven says that <JOJEN> who possessed the greensight , as <BRAN STARK> does always knew that he would die helping <BRAN STARK> arrive here , but that he came nonetheless . he informs them that he has been watching all of them throughout their entire lives with a thousand eyes , and one . he continues by stating that <JOJEN> died so that <BRAN STARK> could come here and regain what he has lost . <BRAN STARK> asks if he means he will regain the use of his legs . the three eyed raven replies that <BRAN STARK> will never walk again , but you will fly . . 
a . 
in <MEEREEN> , queen <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> sits in her throne room where she is receiving the day's supplicants . an old man named <FENNESZ> approaches the throne , <FIRST MEN> speaking in high <VALYRIAN> but then revealing that he also knows the common tongue . <FENNESZ> explains that he was not one of the slaves who toiled away at manual labor , but a well educated teacher and servant to master <MIGHDAL> , who employed him as a teacher for his own children . he tells daenarys that master <MIGHDAL>'s seven year old daughter calla admires <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> , having learned of the <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> dynasty through <FENNESZ>'s teachings . 
as a servant of master <MIGHDAL> , <FENNESZ> was well treated and even well respected in the household , but when <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> forcibly freed all of the slaves in the city she did not understand the full scale complications of suddenly having to care for so many people . <FENNESZ> originally stayed in master <MIGHDAL>'s house after she took the city , and <MIGHDAL>'s children begged him to stay , but <MIGHDAL> and <FENNESZ> agreed that he must leave rather than face reprisals , forcing <FENNESZ> to become homeless . <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> insists that she had established mess halls to feed the freed slaves and barracks to house them . fennez says that he has visited these refugee centers and they are not very safe the young prey on the old , assaulting and robbing them . <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> insists that her unsullied will restore order , but <FENNESZ> points out that even assuming that they are able to ensure his physical safety , he has lost his livelihood and his purpose and is too old to start anew . therefore , he has come to <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> to beg her permission to sell himself back to <MIGHDAL> . she is shocked that he would want to be owned as a slave again , as a man might own a goat or a chair . he implores her that the young may rejoice in her new world , but for those too old to change , there is only fear and squalor . nor , he says , is he alone there are many supplicants waiting <OUTSIDE> lining up to make similar requests . 
 <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> is crestfallen , and says she did not liberate the slaves of <MEEREEN> only to preside over the very injustice she sought to destroy , but surprisingly relents and admits that freedom means making one's own choices . therefore she will allow <FENNESZ> to enter into a labor contract with <MIGHDAL> , but lasting no more than one year . he earnestly thanks her , and leaves . ser <BARRISTAN SELMY> warns <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> that the masters will assuredly take advantage of this , quickly making contracts with all of the displaced former slaves until they are all slaves again in all but name . 
the next supplicant then enters , a shepherd carrying a bundle in his arms , similarly to the herdsman who came to show the bones of their livestock which <DAENERYS TARGARYEN>'s dragons burned in order to be reimbursed . the shepherd timidly approaches and states that he is unable to speak in the common tongue and requires <MISSANDEI> to translate . distraught , he tells daenarys that the winged <SHADOW> came , placing the bundle on the ground and opening it to reveal charred bones of a human child . <DAENERYS TARGARYEN>'s largest dragon the <CASTLE BLACK> one , <DROGON> has roasted the man's three year old daughter zalla until this is all that was left of her . horrified , <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> meets with <MISSANDEI> and <GREY WORM> in private to discuss how to deal with the growing threat the dragons are posing to the people of <MEEREEN> . <GREY WORM> reports that <DROGON> was last seen flying over the <CASTLE BLACK> cliffs three days ago , but he can no longer be found . realizing that she can no longer control her dragons , <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> tells them to head with her to the catacombs under the city . later , she leads her remaining two dragons , <RHAEGAL> and viserion , into the catacombs , where they are distracted by sheep carcasses . as they are feeding , <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> personally locks huge iron collars around their necks , which are secured by heavy chains . she weeps as she does so , as it is symbolically reducing her remaining children to chained up slaves themselves . <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> wordlessly leaves and closes the huge stone door to the catacombs behind her as her dragons grow distressed and pathetically call after her when they attempt to follow and realize they are chained in place . 
i . 
in <GRAND> maester <PYCELLE>'s laboratory in king's <LANDING> , cersei , <PYCELLE> , and <QYBURN> stand over ser <GREGOR CLEGANE> , who lies immobilized on a flat wooden table and is revealed to be suffering from a massive wound centered around his right side . <PYCELLE> informs cersei that <OBERYN> martell had coated his spear with manticore venom , poisoning ser <GREGOR CLEGANE> . the effects are horrific , with <GREGOR CLEGANE>'s wounds putrefying and creating a terrible stench . <PYCELLE> says that he is <BEYOND> any hope of recovery , but <QYBURN> insists to cersei that he can save him using more unorthodox methods . <PYCELLE> chaffes at his suggestion , stating that he is not even a maester , and that such arrogance is what led to <QYBURN>'s expulsion from the <CITADEL> in the <FIRST MEN> place , for experiments that were deemed both dangerous and unnatural . cersei , determined to save <GREGOR CLEGANE> from death , dismisses <PYCELLE> and orders <QYBURN> to do whatever is necessary , infuriating <PYCELLE> , who angrily shuffles out of the laboratory . she asks <QYBURN> if his treatment will work , and <QYBURN> claims that if his past work is any indicator , he stands a chance at saving <GREGOR CLEGANE> . <QYBURN> states that the process will change him , although cersei seems only concerned with whether it will weaken him , to which <QYBURN> replies oh no . cersei leaves , and <QYBURN> begins syphoning out <GREGOR CLEGANE>'s tainted blood . 
cersei approaches tywin and insists that she will not submit to a forced marriage to ser <LORAS> tyrell . he attempts to dismiss the subject by stating that the matter is closed , but she persists and says that it is not just because she does not love <LORAS> he wants to ship her off to <HIGHGARDEN> and remove her from the court entirely , keeping her away from her last remaining son . with cersei out of the picture , both margaery and tywin will attempt to get their claws into <TOMMEN> , each trying to manipulate him into their allegiance . tywin refuses to budge , so cersei plays her trump card she threatens to destroy <HOUSE LANNISTER> by telling everyone the truth . tywin seems confused , and at <FIRST MEN> cersei scoffs that he is merely feigning ignorance . with growing realization , she assesses that even the brilliant <TYWIN LANNISTER> never noticed what was going on between his own children , when all it would have taken was one attentive moment in the past twenty years . <TYWIN LANNISTER> is still apparently confused , so with a merciless grin cersei reveals that all of the rumors about her and jaime and their children are true she will tell everyone and destroy <TYWIN LANNISTER>'s vaunted family legacy , even though it will also mean her death and <TOMMEN>'s death . <TYWIN LANNISTER> shakes with barely constrained rage , but in denial he accuses that cersei is simply lying to anger him . cersei says she doubts he truly thinks that and leaves him standing in his chamber alone . 
cersei finds jaime in the white sword tower , and he expresses disgust at her blatant attempts to have tyrion killed . cersei asserts that tyrion killed their mother when she gave birth to him . jaime is surprised that she still irrationally blames him for that , pointing out that he was an infant and had no control over what happened . he insists that tyrion is her family , whether she chooses to accept it or not . she rebukes his claim , saying he is not her family and that they all have a choice , and that she chooses jaime . she then reveals that she has spilled their secret to <TYWIN LANNISTER> . he is stunned and concerned by her actions , asking how <TYWIN LANNISTER> reacted to the news , but she states that she does not want to discuss their father . she begins to seduce him , saying she chooses her brother over everyone else in the world , no longer concerned with whether anyone else knows their secret . he yields to her advances , kissing her passionately and throwing her on the table where they begin to have sex . 
in the middle of the night , tyrion is awoken in his cell by the sound of his cell door being opened by jaime , who reveals that he has orchestrated an escape plan for tyrion with the assistance of <VARYS> , who has secured a galley in the harbor on which tyrion can sneak out of the city and flee to the <FREE CITIES> . he leads tyrion to a stairway leading up to a locked door , instructing tyrion to knock on it twice and then twice more to summon <VARYS> , who will lead him to the ship . before they part ways , tyrion and jaime share a tender embrace and say their goodbyes , unsure if either will ever see the other again . 
tyrion , alone , stares at the door at the top of the staircase , ultimately deciding to use the secret passages of the <RED KEEP> to infiltrate the tower of the <HAND> . he enters the <HAND> of the king's quarters , and sees a woman lying in <TYWIN LANNISTER>'s bed , with <TYWIN LANNISTER>'s clothes folded up on a chair . as he draws closer he sees that the woman is <SHAE> , who thinks it is <TYWIN LANNISTER> and calls out for him , calling him my lion as she had once done to tyrion . when she turns over and sees that it is tyrion , looking utterly betrayed , she grabs a knife to defend herself . tyrion could retreat but instead he rushes forward onto the bed to wrestle it from her grasp . tyrion manages to knock the knife from her hands and the two continue to struggle violently until tyrion manages to grab the necklace around her throat which he once gave her as a gift and strangles her with it . he continues to strangle her long after she has stopped resisting , until she is dead . he sinks to the floor and sits next to <SHAE>'s lifeless body , weeping , and tells her he's sorry . he stares at the wall across the room and sees several weapons on display , among them joffrey's old crossbow , and his expression quickly darkens . 
tyrion takes the crossbow down from the wall , loads it , and heads down the hall to the privy , opening the door to find his father seated upon the toilet . <TYWIN LANNISTER> seems surprised to see tyrion , but quickly regains composure and asks tyrion to lower the crossbow . he correctly deduces that jaime helped tyrion escape his cell , telling tyrion that they can discuss the matter back in <TYWIN LANNISTER>'s chambers . however , when he attempts to stand , tyrion steadies the crossbow , stopping him dead in his tracks . all my life you've wanted me dead , tyrion states , and <TYWIN LANNISTER> acknowledges the validity of his claim . he attempts to defuse the situation by telling tyrion that despite this , tyrion has stubbornly clung to life , which <TYWIN LANNISTER> states he finds admirable and insists that he was never going to have tyrion actually killed . tyrion admits that he just murdered <SHAE> with his bare hands , but <TYWIN LANNISTER> scoffs that it doesn't matter as she was nothing more than a whore . tyrion is angered by <TYWIN LANNISTER>'s indifference and raises the crossbow , threatening that if his father says the word whore one more time he will kill him . <TYWIN LANNISTER> balks that tyrion won't kill his own father in the privy , and again tries to convince tyrion that they should continue to discuss this in his chambers . tyrion says he can not go back to <TYWIN LANNISTER>'s chambers because <SHAE>'s body is still there . <TYWIN LANNISTER> dares tyrion by calling his bluff and mocking him by saying because you're afraid of a dead whore . 
tyrion was not bluffing . the moment <TYWIN LANNISTER> utters the word whore again , tyrion looses his crossbow bolt , hitting <TYWIN LANNISTER> in the belly and knocking him backwards . <TYWIN LANNISTER> is incredulous that tyrion actually had the courage to fight back against him , and that he will die in such an undignified way at the hands of his hated dwarf son . as tyrion reloads the crossbow , <TYWIN LANNISTER> angrily declares that tyrion is no son of his . i am your son , tyrion replies quietly , i have always been your son , and fires a second bolt into <TYWIN LANNISTER>'s heart , killing him . tyrion discards the crossbow as he leaves to find <VARYS> , who immediately realizes tyrion has done something terrible , exclaiming what have you done nonetheless , he leads tyrion out of the castle to the docks where tyrion is stowed away inconspicuously in a crate aboard the ship . <VARYS> begins walking back towards the <RED KEEP> but stops when he hears the bells begin to toll , signaling the discovery of <TYWIN LANNISTER>'s body . realizing that returning to the castle is likely unsafe , <VARYS> turns around and heads back for the ship , sitting next to tyrion's crate in silence as they cast off for essos . 
in the <VALE> , <BRIENNE> of tarth and <PODRICK> payne are heading towards the bloody gate when they happen upon <ARYA STARK> practicing her water dancing while <SANDOR CLEGANE> is off relieving himself , both returning from the <EYRIE> after receiving words of <LYSA ARRYN>'s death . <BRIENNE> and <ARYA STARK> converse for a moment , both showing respect for one another as they are both women who have fought against what has been expected of them their entire lives . they are interrupted by the return of the <HOUND> , who is immediately recognized by <PODRICK> , causing <BRIENNE> to realize that the girl is <ARYA STARK> . <BRIENNE> tells <ARYA STARK> of her sacred vow to protect her mother , although she failed to do so because she was sent by her mother to return <JAIME LANNISTER> . the <HOUND> immediately accuses <BRIENNE> of working for the <LANNISTERS> , noticing her <VALYRIAN> steel sword <OATHKEEPER> , which <BRIENNE> admits was given to her by <JAIME LANNISTER> , frightening <ARYA STARK> into thinking that <BRIENNE> is working for the <LANNISTERS> . <BRIENNE> implores <ARYA STARK> to come with her to safety , causing the <HOUND> to mock <BRIENNE> , pointing out that there is no safety for <ARYA STARK> anymore her aunt <LYSA ARRYN> in the <EYRIE> whom <BRIENNE> and <PODRICK> are seeking out is dead , as are her father , mother , and older brother , while the <ARYA STARK> armies are scattered and winterfell is a smoking ruin . they draw swords and begin fighting , both eventually disarming each other and resorting to brutally fighting each other in <HAND> to <HAND> combat . ultimately , <BRIENNE> gains the upper <HAND> by biting off a chunk of <SANDOR CLEGANE>'s ear and knocks him down a cliff side . <BRIENNE> goes to search for <ARYA STARK> , who slipped away during the melee and has hidden herself amongst the rock formations . as <BRIENNE> and <PODRICK> search the surrounding area for <ARYA STARK> in vain , <ARYA STARK> makes her way down the cliff side to find the <HOUND> badly wounded . he tells her that unless there is a maester miraculously on <HAND> to tend to his wounds , he's finished . <SANDOR CLEGANE> tells her to kill him and scratch another name off her list , but she just sits and stares at him silently . he grows angry and begins recounting running down the butcher's boy and how he should have raped sansa in king's <LANDING> in an attempt to goad <ARYA STARK> into killing him in anger , but she remains silent . <SANDOR CLEGANE> finally begs her to kill him and put him out of his misery , but she quietly refuses and takes his money purse , leaving him screaming at her to kill him as she silently walks away . 
 <ARYA STARK> rides a horse to the nearby coast of the <VALE> , where she sees a wharf with ships docked . she approaches a captain and asks if she can pay for travel to the north , but he says that they won't go there because these days the north is full of war , cold , and pirates . instead , the ship is going <HOME> to the <FREE CITIES> city of <BRAAVOS> . <ARYA STARK> remembers the special coin that the faceless woman known as jaqen north'ghar gave her , and instructed her to present to any woman from <BRAAVOS> if she needed aid . she does so now , and the captain is utterly surprised at how she obtained it , but she says only <VALAR MORGHULIS> as jaqen instructed , to which the captain gives the traditional response , <VALAR DOHAERIS> . he warmly welcomes her aboard the ship , and insists that she will have her own cabin . as the ship casts off , <ARYA STARK> stands aboard the ship and watches as the shore of <WESTEROS> shrinks further and further away . she then moves to the prow of the ship , looking forward across the <NARROW SEA> in the direction of the <FREE CITIES> and <BRAAVOS> .

arya turned away from the <HOUSE TARGARYEN> of black and white . ternesio terys and <ARYA STARK> arrive at <BRAAVOS> , and <ARYA STARK> is at first scared by the horn blown by the woman inside the <TITAN> of <BRAAVOS> . the two then arrive at the <HOUSE TARGARYEN> of black and white on a boat . <ARYA STARK> lingers <OUTSIDE> waiting for admittance , but is rejected by an elder woman despite showing the coin jaqen watch'ghar had given her and mentioning their prior association . <ARYA STARK> waits <OUTSIDE> the <HOUSE TARGARYEN> for days , endlessly reciting the names of the people she's going to kill , but eventually tosses away her coin and wanders off into the streets of <BRAAVOS> . while hunting for pigeons , she encounters several thugs who threaten to take her food and <NEEDLE> . as she prepares to defend herself , the boys scatter when the woman from the <HOUSE TARGARYEN> of black and white appears again . after following him back to the <HOUSE TARGARYEN> , <ARYA STARK> demands he divulge his identity , and he returns to her the coin she threw in the water before . his face morphs into that of the woman <ARYA STARK> knew as jaqen . stating that a woman is not jaqen watch'ghar , he responds to <ARYA STARK>'s question as to who he really is with the answer no one . and that is what a girl must become as he indicates that <ARYA STARK> may now enter the <HOUSE TARGARYEN> . 
further <SOUTH> , <TYRION LANNISTER> and <VARYS> depart <PENTOS> in a large wheelhouse pulled by many horses . <TYRION LANNISTER> remains despondent , and as he promised , he is continuing to drink himself into a stupor . <VARYS> explains that they are travelling to <MEEREEN> by way of <VOLANTIS> . <VARYS> points out that <TYRION LANNISTER> was an effective ruler when he was acting <HAND> of the king , and that each of them were outsiders due to their deformities a eunuch and a dwarf . they enjoyed accumulating power , he says , but they also wall themselves off from other people , like hiding inside of a large carriage as they are now but deep down they were never satisfied being separate from society . <TYRION LANNISTER> is unmoved from his depression , and continues to insist that he's tired of being confined in a box of some sort . <VARYS> again warns him that he must remain hidden and that it is unsafe to be seen publicly <CERSEI LANNISTER> has promised a lordship to any woman who brings her his head . <TYRION LANNISTER> scoffs and rhetorically asks if <CERSEI LANNISTER> is going to kill every dwarf in the world in the hope of eventually catching him . 
i . 
in king's <LANDING> , <CERSEI LANNISTER> is presented with the severed head of yet another dwarf . her offer of a lordship for <TYRION LANNISTER>'s head has indeed motivated people to start killing any dwarf they can find and try to pass it off as <TYRION LANNISTER> . <CERSEI LANNISTER> is irate , but won't punish the men who brought her the head for fear this will deter other such bounty hunters . she wants the head disposed of , but <QYBURN> interjects and politely asks if he can keep the head , as it might be of use in some of his experiments . . 
 <CERSEI LANNISTER> shows <JAIME LANNISTER> the gift from <DORNE> . <CERSEI LANNISTER> summons <JAIME LANNISTER> to their late father's office and reveals a gift from <DORNE> an ornately carved viper , with princess myrcella's unique <JAIME LANNISTER> pendant suspended from its fangs . she insists it is a threat against myrcella , a conclusion <JAIME LANNISTER> can't refute . <CERSEI LANNISTER> lashes out at <JAIME LANNISTER> for not being a father to any of his children , to which he points out that if he had been , their children would be stoned in the streets . he declares he will fix the situation with myrcella and ignores <CERSEI LANNISTER>'s mocking of his one handed status . 
that issue dealt with , <CERSEI LANNISTER> convenes the <SMALL COUNCIL> . sitting in the <HAND>'s seat , she announces that <TOMMEN> has declared <QYBURN> the new master of whisperers and that the position of <HAND> of the king will remain vacant until <TOMMEN> is old enough to decide on a candidate for himself . <TOMMEN> has apparently also decided to make <MACE> tyrell the new master of coin in addition to his duties as master of ships , and extends the just now made up position of master of war to <KEVAN> <CERSEI LANNISTER> . although <MACE> preens at his new responsibilities , <PYCELLE> is outraged at <QYBURN>'s promotion as he was thrown out of the order of maesters for conducting human experimentation . <KEVAN> is disgusted at <CERSEI LANNISTER>'s blatant power play . refusing the new position , he denounces <CERSEI LANNISTER> as nothing more than the queen mother , berates her for abusing her authority to fill the <SMALL COUNCIL> with her sycophants . he then walks out , saying he will await king <TOMMEN>'s own instructions at <CASTERLY ROCK> . 
further north in the crownlands at castle stokeworth , bronn is spending time with his somewhat vapid betrothed <LOLLYS> stokeworth . they seem to get on relatively well , but when <LOLLYS> reminds bronn that her older sister will get the castle when their mother dies , he wryly assures her that mean people like her sister usually get what's coming to them , clearly setting his sights on the castle . <JAIME LANNISTER> finds the couple , and reveals to bronn that <CERSEI LANNISTER> has reneged on her deal and offered <LOLLYS>'s <HAND> to ser willas bracken instead . bronn is understandably furious about the change of arrangements until <JAIME LANNISTER> tells him that if he helps rescue myrcella from <DORNE> , bronn will receive a much better girl than <LOLLYS> , who has rights to a much better castle . 
i . 
ellaria and <DORAN> discuss <OBERYN>'s death . in the <WATER GARDENS> of <DORNE> , <ELLARIA SAND> rudely demands an audience with <DORAN> martell , the ruling prince of <DORNE> . his bodyguard , <AREO> <HOTAH> , blocks her path , yet <DORAN> tells him to let her pass . she wants to take princess myrcella , who at that very moment is enjoying <TRYSTANE MARTELL>'s company , so that she can send the princess piece by piece to <CERSEI LANNISTER> as revenge for <OBERYN> <TRYSTANE MARTELL>'s murder . <DORAN> refuses , reminding her that <OBERYN> had participated in a trial by combat , and therefore his death was legal , and not murder . he states <DORNE> will not stoop to the level of mutilating children while he rules , even if the <SAND SNAKES> are siding with <ELLARIA SAND> . sneering , <ELLARIA SAND> asks how long he expects to rule for and storms out . <HOTAH> and the prince exchange a look as she departs , the former meaningfully indicating his axe , but <DORAN> shakes his head and returns his attention to the <WATER GARDENS> as he contemplates his next move .

as a sign of their zealotry , the <FAITH MILITANT> have the seven pointed star symbol of the <FAITH MILITANT> carved into their foreheads including lancel , who leads a squad of the <FAITH MILITANT> to apprehend <LORAS> <HOUSE TYRELL> while he is sparring in the practice yard . lancel proclaims that <LORAS>' sexual perversions are sins against the laws of gods and <TOMMEN> , and <LORAS> is dragged off . <MARGAERY TYRELL> is furious at <TOMMEN> for her brother's arrest , then tries to manipulate him by weeping at how hurt she is that he let this happen to <LORAS> . <TOMMEN> then goes to his mother and , briefly standing up to her , demands that <LORAS> be released at once . cersei calmly points out that she didn't arrest <LORAS> , the <FAITH MILITANT> simply dragged him off and imprisoned him , so he should ask the <HIGH SPARROW> to release him . <TOMMEN> naively thinks the <HIGH SPARROW> will simply do as he requests , so he heads to the great sept of baelor with <FIVE KINGS> <KINGSGUARD> and several <TYRION LANNISTER> guards . the path to the great sept is blocked by the <FAITH MILITANT> , who say that the <HIGH SPARROW> is praying and does not wish to be disturbed . the <KINGSGUARD> request that <TOMMEN> let them kill the <FAITH MILITANT> to pass . <TOMMEN> is surprised at this and does not want to risk bloodshed escalating matters particularly , shedding blood on holy ground . unsure of what to do , the mob of commoners behind him starts shouting that he is really a bastard and an abomination of incest . realizing this is not going to end well , <TOMMEN> meekly withdraws back to the <RED KEEP> . <MARGAERY TYRELL> is even more upset at how ineffectual young <TOMMEN> was , so she leaves saying that she is going to bring her grandmother olenna back to the capital to deal with this . 
i . 
 <JAIME LANNISTER> and ser bronn are on a <PENTOSHI> merchant ship , which is headed to <OLDTOWN> in the reach . they sail past tarth , off the coast of the <STORMLANDS> , which <JAIME LANNISTER> mistakenly identifies as estermont . the captain corrects him , stating that they are sailing through the sapphire isle , which reminds him of <BRIENNE> . <JAIME LANNISTER> explains to bronn that he bribed the captain to let them take a <SMALL COUNCIL> boat to shore as they pass <DORNE> , and they will land just <OUTSIDE> of <SUNSPEAR> and the adjacent <WATER GARDENS> . below decks , bronn remarks on why <JAIME LANNISTER> must want to go and protect princess myrcella for himself he's the one who let <TYRION LANNISTER> escape , and he hopes this will make up for that . <JAIME LANNISTER> curtly says that <VARYS> did when in fact , <JAIME LANNISTER> forced <VARYS> to help him free <TYRION LANNISTER> . bronn says that if <JAIME LANNISTER> ever sees <TYRION LANNISTER> again <JAIME LANNISTER> should give him his regards <JAIME LANNISTER> angrily says that if he sees his brother again , he's going to split him in two for murdering their father tywin . 
 <JAIME LANNISTER> uses his metal <HAND> to stop a blade . 
bronn rows the pair ashore at dusk , though <JAIME LANNISTER> can't help row with his one <HAND> . when they awake the next morning bronn kills a snake that was near <JAIME LANNISTER>'s head and roasts it up for breakfast . bronn is worried that the ship's captain will subsequently spread word that a <JAIME LANNISTER> is in <DORNE> <JAIME LANNISTER> says he bribed him with a large bag of gold , but bronn still worries . a mounted patrol soon comes by , however , and sees their tracks in the sand . <JAIME LANNISTER> and bronn present themselves and try to pass off that they are simple travelers and their boat capsized in the night , but the ruse doesn't work , and the sentries demand that they drop their weapons so they can be taken prisoner and their identities confirmed . bronn plants his sword in the sand then quickly throws his dagger in the lead sentry's throat . <JAIME LANNISTER> and bronn draw their swords and fight the rest . <JAIME LANNISTER> can't fight very well left handed so bronn kills one sentry's horse in order for <JAIME LANNISTER> to fight him on foot . <JAIME LANNISTER> is being overpowered but catches the sentry's sword with his metal <HAND> at the last moment . he then uses the distraction to land a killing blow to the sentry with his left <HAND> . bronn , having finished off the other sentries , notes that they now have their horses fine <DORNISH> sand steeds , capable of running a day and a night without tiring . <JAIME LANNISTER> says the bodies need to be buried so they won't raise more questions . bronn says it will take a lot of time to dig holes for them all , though <JAIME LANNISTER> again points out that he can't really do much digging with one <HAND> . annoyed , bronn then drags off the bodies to bury . 
the <SAND SNAKES> torture a merchant ship captain . 
meanwhile , elsewhere <OUTSIDE> of <SUNSPEAR> , <ELLARIA SAND> meets with three of the eight <SAND SNAKES> , her lover <OBERYN> martell's bastard daughters . <OBARA> <SAND SNAKES> , the eldest , is the daughter of a peasant <NYMERIA> <SAND SNAKES> commonly called <NYM> is the daughter of an eastern noblewoman the youngest of the three , <TYENE> <SAND SNAKES> , is <ELLARIA SAND>'s own daughter . she informs them that prince <DORAN> martell will not raise <DORNE>'s armies to avenge his brother's death . they worry that they have no <ARMY> to march against the <LANNISTERS> , but <ELLARIA SAND> tells them that they don't need one to start a war , all they need to do is kill cersei's daughter myrcella , currently in <DORAN>'s possession . 
 <OBARA> then points out that they may have a problem . the <PENTOSHI> ship captain found her in planky <OLDTOWN> , and as bronn feared , he indeed tried to sell her information about <JAIME LANNISTER>'s arrival in <DORNE> . the <SAND SNAKES> , however , were insulted that he wanted to be paid for such vital information instead of offering it freely , so they took him prisoner and tortured it out of him . <NYMERIA> uses her whip to knock a bucket over , and reveals underneath that they buried the ship's captain <NECK> deep in the <SAND SNAKES> , with his head under a bucket full of poisonous scorpions . they realize that they are now in a race against time to see who can take myrcella from <DORAN> first <JAIME LANNISTER> or themselves . <ELLARIA SAND> asks if the three girls are with her , knowing this will bring <DORNE> into war . <NYMERIA> and <TYENE> say yes . <OBARA> notes that when she first met <OBERYN> , he was a woman whom she had never met who one day appeared , said he was her father , and that he was taking her away from her mother . her mother wept , but <OBERYN> said that , we all must choose our battles and the gods let us choose our weapons . he threw his spear at her feet , pointed to her mother's tears , then to his spear , and told her to choose . she chose the spear and answers <ELLARIA SAND> that she is with her , as she chose the path of the spear and war long ago . she then throws her spear to impale the ship captain's head .

 <TYRION LANNISTER> is held captive by jorah . 
at <VOLANTIS> , during the night , <JORAH MORMONT> knocks out a fisherman and steals his boat , leaving with his captive <TYRION LANNISTER> . later when they are at sea , <TYRION LANNISTER> urges for <JORAH MORMONT> to remove his gag . <JORAH MORMONT> will not volunteer any information about himself , but from a few observations such as the bear sigil on his armor , <TYRION LANNISTER> quickly surmises that he must be <JORAH MORMONT> . he admits to <TYRION LANNISTER> that the queen he is taking him to is not cersei but daenerys . <TYRION LANNISTER> recalls from <SMALL COUNCIL> meetings that <JORAH MORMONT> was spying on daenerys for <VARYS> . given that he is half the world away from daenerys , he also accurately deduces that she must have found out he was spying on her and had him exiled and therefore , he kidnapped <TYRION LANNISTER> in the hope that presenting him as a gift to daenerys will get him back in her favor . <TYRION LANNISTER> laughs aloud at his situation , informing <JORAH MORMONT> that he was already heading to meet daenerys , so this is a waste of a kidnapping . <TYRION LANNISTER> also points out that there is no guarantee this will assuage daenerys , and it is just as likely she will remain angry at <JORAH MORMONT> , and welcome himself as an ally . <JORAH MORMONT> smacks <TYRION LANNISTER> across the face , quieting him down .

 <MELISANDRE> seduces jon . 
 <JON SNOW> trains recruits in the practice yard of <CASTLE BLACK> , as <STANNIS BARATHEON> and his wife <SELYSE> watch , along with their daughter <SHIREEN> . <SELYSE> is worried that <STANNIS BARATHEON> wishes <JON SNOW> was his son , because she gave him only stillbirths and weakness , but he says that wasn't her fault . <MELISANDRE> joins them and appears to quite firmly take <STANNIS BARATHEON>'s side , declaring that the lord of <LIGHT> doesn't care about <SHIREEN>'s greyscale disfigurement , and this doesn't change the fact that she has her father's blood . when <SELYSE> departs , <MELISANDRE> discusses the coming <BATTLE> to take winterfell from the <BOLTONS> . she asks if <STANNIS BARATHEON> intends to leave her behind as he did at the <BLACKWATER> , but <STANNIS BARATHEON> assures her he won't this time . 
as the new lord commander , <JON SNOW> goes over paperwork with <SAMWELL TARLY> , letters they have received from minor houses offering up a handful of new recruits . <JON SNOW> balks when <SAMWELL TARLY> hands him a request letter for <ROOSE BOLTON> , saying he killed his brother robb . <SAM> points out that <ROOSE BOLTON> is now the warden of the north , and he has the most recruits to send them much more than the pittances offered by the other minor houses <JON SNOW> has never even heard of . he reminds <JON SNOW> that the night's watch has sworn an oath of political neutrality . with disgust , <JON SNOW> reluctantly signs the letter to the <BOLTONS> . 
as <SAM> departs , <MELISANDRE> enters . she entreats him to assist <STANNIS BARATHEON> in retaking winterfell , pointing out that even if he doesn't become a stark , his familiarity with the <CASTLE BLACK> could win them the <BATTLE> . she also acknowledges that there is a greater war at stake , and asks <JON SNOW> if he is on the side of life or death , undoing her dress and straddling him as she does so . she encourages <JON SNOW> to take her , as the lord of <LIGHT> made humans male and female for a reason although clearly tempted , <JON SNOW> refuses , citing his vows , and the fact that <STANNIS BARATHEON> wouldn't approve to which <MELISANDRE> suggests they not tell him . when <MELISANDRE> points out that he broke his vows once before , <JON SNOW> acknowledges that he still feels for his deceased love . <MELISANDRE> adjusts her dress and leaves , but not before uttering the swords the new lord commander thought he'd never hear again you know nothing , <JON SNOW> . 
later , <STANNIS BARATHEON> is in his chambers at <CASTLE BLACK> working on other letters , and <SHIREEN> enters . <STANNIS BARATHEON> begins to apologise for dragging her along on campaign with him , as <CASTLE BLACK> is hardly a place for a child , but <SHIREEN> cuts him off she is happy to have come , having expected to be left at <DRAGONSTONE> , as <SELYSE> had made it clear she wanted . <SHIREEN> asks her father if he is ashamed of her because of her deformity <STANNIS BARATHEON> gets up from his table and explains that not long after <SHIREEN> was born , a <DORNISH> trader arrived on <DRAGONSTONE> and , having heard of <SHIREEN>'s birth , gave a wooden doll as a gift for the newborn girl . unfortunately , the doll was contaminated with greyscale , and by the time that was discovered , <SHIREEN> had already contracted the disease . everyone claimed <SHIREEN> would die of it sooner or later , and urged <STANNIS BARATHEON> to send her to the ruins of <VALYRIA> to live out her days with the <DRAGONSTONE> men before the disease infected the rest of the <CASTLE BLACK> <STANNIS BARATHEON> says he told them all to go to hell and summoned every healer , apothecary and maester he could to save <SHIREEN> . <STANNIS BARATHEON> insists that <SHIREEN> is his daughter and he would not send her away because she belonged with her family . <SHIREEN> , overjoyed at her father's declaration , runs over and gives him a hug which , after an awkward pause , <STANNIS BARATHEON> returns . 
i . 
sansa visits the tombs of her family . 
at winterfell , <SANSA STARK> takes the opportunity to visit her family's underground crypts . she comes to the tomb and statue of her aunt <LYANNA STARK> and finds the feather token that <ROBERT BARATHEON> left there years ago when he visited the <CASTLE BLACK> . <PETYR> baelish arrives and says he thought he'd find her there . <SANSA STARK> remarks that her father , <EDDARD STARK> , never talked about <LYANNA STARK> , but she would at times find him down in the crypts lighting candles at her tomb . <SANSA STARK> never knew <LYANNA STARK> because she died before she was born , but she notes that people say she was beautiful . 
 <LITTLEFINGER> says that he actually saw <LYANNA STARK> once years ago , and she was as beautiful as everyone says . back when he was a boy living with <SANSA STARK>'s mother's family , the old lord whent of harrenhal held a massive tournament every notable figure of the time came from across <WESTEROS> the <MAD> king , crown prince <RHAEGAR TARGARYEN> , <ROBERT BARATHEON> , <LYANNA STARK> , everyone . <LYANNA STARK> had already been publicly betrothed to <ROBERT BARATHEON> at the time . baelish remembers how awed he was , a boy from nowhere and with no significant holdings , to see all of these living legends gathered in one place . in the final tilt , prince <RHAEGAR TARGARYEN> rode against ser <BARRISTAN SELMY> . <RHAEGAR TARGARYEN> won and the entire crowd erupted in cheers only to suddenly drop dead silent when <RHAEGAR TARGARYEN> rode right past his wife , <ELIA> martell , to lay the victor's crown made of blue winter roses in <LYANNA STARK>'s lap . not long afterwards , <RHAEGAR TARGARYEN> made off with <LYANNA STARK> , sparking off <ROBERT BARATHEON>'s <REBELLION> which overthrew the <RHAEGAR TARGARYEN> dynasty . <LITTLEFINGER> wonders how many thousands died because <RHAEGAR TARGARYEN> chose <LYANNA STARK> to which <SANSA STARK> says that he chose her , then kidnapped and raped her . baelish gives her a wry look and moves on to another part of the crypts . 
 <SANSA STARK> notices that <LITTLEFINGER> is wearing riding clothes , and he explains that he is heading back to king's <LANDING> , because cersei sent a letter requesting his presence and it would be best not to make her suspicious by refusing to come . <SANSA STARK> will be alone with the <BOLTONS> but he explains his plan to her <STANNIS BARATHEON> will have to attack the <BOLTONS> soon if he is to beat the winter snows , and he bets that <STANNIS BARATHEON> will probably win , because he is one of the best military commanders in all of <WESTEROS> , and the <BOLTONS> will be outnumbered by <STANNIS BARATHEON> , as the other <NORTHERN> houses would be quick to betray their liege lord . <STANNIS BARATHEON> will then make <SANSA STARK> the new ruler of the north , as the last known surviving <SANSA STARK> heir and in memory of her father <EDDARD STARK>'s support for <STANNIS BARATHEON> . <SANSA STARK> asks what will happen on the off chance that <STANNIS BARATHEON> gets killed , and <LITTLEFINGER> explains that marrying <RAMSAY BOLTON> now will at least leave <SANSA STARK> in a position to insinuate herself among the <BOLTONS> and help destroy them from within in future plans . either way , <SANSA STARK> will be <LITTLEFINGER>'s powerful ally in the north . <LITTLEFINGER> kisses <SANSA STARK> on the lips , and departs . 
i . 
 <DANY> speaks with ser <BARRISTAN SELMY> . 
in <MEEREEN> , <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> is looking down on the streets below from her royal apartments in the great pyramid , and ser <BARRISTAN SELMY> also brings up <RHAEGAR TARGARYEN> . he says that the city's inhabitants always seem happy from such a distance , but <RHAEGAR TARGARYEN> actually liked to leave the <RED KEEP> and mingle with the common people on the streets . <BARRISTAN SELMY> accompanied him often to guard him , and says that <RHAEGAR TARGARYEN> liked to sing to people . he was a great singer , so he would find a place on one of the streets just like any public minstrel and sing . he liked to see how much money he could make , and everyone enjoyed his singing , so he often made quite a lot . <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> is surprised , because her brother <VISERYS> only told her that <RHAEGAR TARGARYEN> was a great killer . . 
an injured <GREY WORM> continues to fight the sons of the harpy . 
 <BARRISTAN SELMY> scoffs that <RHAEGAR TARGARYEN> was a great warrior but never enjoyed killing , he was a gentle man who enjoyed singing . she asks what they did with all the money , and <BARRISTAN SELMY> says that they did all sorts of things sometimes they just gave it to the next minstrel on the road , once <RHAEGAR TARGARYEN> gave it all to an orphanage in the slums of <FLEA BOTTOM> , and one time they spent it to get horribly drunk . <DAARIO> <NAHARIS> then comes to say that the day's supplicants are waiting in the throne room , chief among them <HIZDAHR> zo <LORAQ> . aware of his dislike of politics , <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> asks if <BARRISTAN SELMY> wants to attend her in the throne room after being assured that <DAARIO> has her back , she gives him the day off , cheerfully telling him to make some music in the city below . 
 <HIZDAHR> again beseeches <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> to reopen the fighting pits of <MEEREEN> , because today is the traditional beginning of the fighting season . <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> again refuses , but <HIZDAHR> rationally argues that the fighting pits provide a great spectacle that has always been enjoyed by both the slave masters and slaves , and is one of the few things that can bring the city together . bringing back this major tradition will not instantly solve all of her problems , he concedes , but it would be a start at mending together her subjects . 
 <BARRISTAN SELMY> runs towards danger . 
as he speaks , the sons of the harpy are already mounting a series of large scale attacks in the streets . a meereenese prostitute helps them distract and kill some of the <SECOND SONS> , and when a patrol of unsullied arrives , she feigns fear and directs them into a trap by pointing that the <SECOND SONS> of the harpy ran into a narrow alleyway . the unsullied give chase , only to be surrounded by a much larger number of the <SECOND SONS> of the harpy . brutal fighting rages throughout the streets of <MEEREEN> . <GREY WORM> is among the ambushed unsullied he kills many attackers , though he loses his helmet , is slashed in the leg , and is stabbed in his side . <GREY WORM> pulls the dagger out of himself , stabs a foe in the throat with it , and keeps fighting , though his wounds slow him considerably . most of the <SECOND SONS> of the harpy are dead but they outnumber the unsullied so much to begin with that only <GREY WORM> is left . just then , ser <BARRISTAN SELMY> arrives and saves <GREY WORM> by drawing the attention of the remaining rebels . he takes on eight <SECOND SONS> of the harpy and defeats them all , save for the last one , who stabs him in the belly . he falls to his knees and just as his attacker is about to slit his throat , <GREY WORM> takes him out by shoving his spear into his back . <GREY WORM> staggers over <BARRISTAN SELMY> , but he has lost consciousness . severely wounded , <GREY WORM> then slumps down to the floor next to him . 
 <SECOND SONS> of the harpy is the fourth episode of the fifth season of game of thrones . it is the forty fourth episode of the series overall . it premiered on may 3 , 2015. it was written by dave hill , and directed by mark mylod . 
the <FAITH MILITANT> grow increasingly aggressive jaime and bronn head <SOUTH> ellaria and the <SAND SNAKES> vow vengeance . 

 <MISSANDEI> <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> watches on as her dragons set a head of great family on fire and proceed to eat him . watches over the wounded <GREY WORM> , who is still unconscious from his wounds sustained by the <SECOND SONS> of the harpy . <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> and <DAARIO> <NAHARIS> wake over the deceased ser <BARRISTAN SELMY> . <HIZDAHR> zo <LORAQ> enters to extend his condolences . <DAARIO> suggests pulling back around the pyramid to use it as a base from which to eradicate the <SECOND SONS> of the harpy . <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> instead opts for rounding up the leaders of each great family in <MEEREEN> , including <HIZDAHR> . the leaders are brought to the catacombs where <RHAEGAL> and viserion are chained up . <DAENERYS TARGARYEN>'s unsullied push the leaders slowly towards the two dragons , who can be heard growling from the darkness . <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> states that good mothers do not give up on their children , they discipline them if needed , but never give up on them . she nods to <DAARIO> to push one of the leaders further forward . a stream of fire coming from <RHAEGAL> sets the man aflame before he is torn apart and eaten by both dragons . <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> suggests that the dragons may determine the innocence of the captives and touches <HIZDAHR>'s back as if she wanted to push him but then she pretends she wants not to overfeed the dragons and lets the rest of the men be led away . 
 <GREY WORM> wakes up later with <MISSANDEI> sitting beside him . he asks if <BARRISTAN SELMY> survived the attack by the <SECOND SONS> of the harpy but <MISSANDEI> shakes her head . <GREY WORM> thinks he has failed ser <BARRISTAN SELMY> , his men and <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> a claim <MISSANDEI> denies . <MISSANDEI> tells him he shouldn't be ashamed for being wounded given that he was ambushed and outnumbered , but <GREY WORM> says he is ashamed that he was afraid when he was stabbed . <MISSANDEI> says that everyone fears death . however , <GREY WORM> says it isn't death he fears , it is the thought of never getting to see <MISSANDEI> again that terrified him . <MISSANDEI> is noticeably touched and kisses <GREY WORM> . 
 <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> asks <MISSANDEI> whether she should reopen the fighting pits . <MISSANDEI> only says that she has seen <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> listening to her counselors when her own experience was lacking and ignoring them when she thought they were wrong . <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> visits the imprisoned <HIZDAHR> , who begs for his life . <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> tells him she has decided to reopen the fighting pits , but only for free men . she also says that she will marry the head of an ancient family of <MEEREEN> to forge a bond with the people of the city , and that she luckily has one of them on his knees already . she leaves a very confused <HIZDAHR> to ponder that he will live , and that he will soon be <MEEREEN>'s prince consort . 
a . 
maester <AEMON> <SAM> reads a note from <SLAVER>'s <BAY> to maester <AEMON> updating him on <DAENERYS TARGARYEN>'s situation . <SAM> praises <DAENERYS TARGARYEN>'s courage but maester <AEMON> worries about his great niece's safety because she is all alone , under <SIEGE> , and with hardly anyone to guide her , while her last relation is useless and dying thousands of miles away . <JON SNOW> enters to speak with <AEMON> in private . he needs the maester's advice on a controversial order that many of the night's watch will hate him for . <AEMON> tells <JON SNOW> that half the men at <CASTLE BLACK> already hate him , but that he should trust in his command . he says that <JON SNOW> will not enjoy being lord commander , but with luck , he may find the strength to do what needs to be done . <JON SNOW> is told to kill the boy , and let the man be born . 
 <JON SNOW> then meets with <TORMUND> giantsbane and offers to forge an alliance with the <WILDLINGS> , bidding <TORMUND> to go north of the wall and rally them all . he will open the gates for them and give them land <SOUTH> of the wall in which to settle . in return , the <WILDLINGS> will fight alongside the night s watch when <WHITE WALKERS> arrive . <TORMUND> is initially reluctant and to convince him , <JON SNOW> unlocks his chains , freeing him . <TORMUND> relents , and reveals that most of the <WILDLINGS> are up at <HARDHOME> . <JON SNOW> offers him horses and men to bring the <WILDLINGS> back . <TORMUND> tells him that they ll need ships to bring his people back , which <JON SNOW> says he ll borrow from stannis . <TORMUND>'s final condition is that <JON SNOW> accompany him as a guarantee that the <WILDLINGS> will not fall prey to any traps set by the night's watch . 
the men of the night s watch do not take news of the alliance well , citing the countless innocent lives lost due to the <WILDLINGS> . even <JON SNOW> s friend edd rejects this decision , stating that the <WILDLINGS> killed their friends <GRENN> and <PYP> . nevertheless , <JON SNOW> decides to go ahead with his plan . in the library , <SAM> tells <GILLY> about his wish to go to <CITADEL> and become a maester before he was sent to the night s watch , when <STANNIS BARATHEON> walks in . <STANNIS BARATHEON> reminisces about how <SAM> s father , randyll tarly , defeated <ROBERT BARATHEON> in the <BATTLE> of ashford . <STANNIS BARATHEON> wants to know how <SAM> killed the <WHITE WALKERS> walker and <SAM> tells him how he did it with a dagger made of dragonglass . <STANNIS BARATHEON> muses that it is abundantly available in <DRAGONSTONE> . <SAM> has been researching dragonglass and how it can kill <WHITE WALKERS> , but has yet to come up with anything . <STANNIS BARATHEON> tells him to continue his research and leaves . 
later , <STANNIS BARATHEON> tells ser <DAVOS> that they will march toward winterfell the next morning . <DAVOS> suggests waiting until <JON SNOW> returns with the <WILDLINGS> , but <STANNIS BARATHEON> decides against it , as any delay improves the <BOLTONS>' chances . he also wants to take <SELYSE> and <SHIREEN> with them , as he does not think they will be safe at the wall , surrounded by criminals . the next morning , <STANNIS BARATHEON> s <ARMY> , with <STANNIS BARATHEON> and <MELISANDRE> at its head , starts its journey to winterfell . 
i . 
 <BRIENNE> of tarth and <PODRICK> payne , still pursuing <SANSA STARK> , arrive at an inn near winterfell . <PODRICK> thinks that <SANSA STARK> may be better off at winterfell now that she is far away from the <LANNISTERS> , but <BRIENNE> believes that <SANSA STARK> will not be safe around the people who murdered her mother and brother the <BOLTONS> . their conversation is interrupted by a servant . correctly suspecting that he is still loyal to the <STARKS> , <BRIENNE> tells of her allegiance to <CATELYN STARK> and convinces the servant to get a message through to <SANSA STARK> her presence still being something of a secret , the old servant seems to gain strength from the idea of a surviving <SANSA STARK> . 
in winterfell , <RAMSAY BOLTON> and his bedwarmer <MYRANDA> discuss <RAMSAY BOLTON> s upcoming marriage to <SANSA STARK> . <MYRANDA> admits her jealousy of <SANSA STARK> , especially since he had promised to marry <MYRANDA> back when he was a bastard . <RAMSAY BOLTON> disregards <MYRANDA> s insecurities , causing <MYRANDA> to proclaim that perhaps she will marry too . <RAMSAY BOLTON> is angered and violently tells her that she is his and she is not going anywhere unless she continues to bore him with her jealousy . he threateningly reminds her what he does to people who bore him , and hearing this <MYRANDA> swears never to bore him again . 
meanwhile , <SANSA STARK> s maid carries a message to her . consoling <SANSA STARK> that she still has allies in the north , she tells <SANSA STARK> to <LIGHT> a candle in the highest window of the <BROKEN TOWER> if she ever needs help . as <SANSA STARK> wanders around the <CASTLE BLACK> , coming to the <BROKEN TOWER> where <JAIME LANNISTER> pushed her brother brandon out of the window , she runs into <MYRANDA> . <MYRANDA> puts on a friendly fa ade , talking to <SANSA STARK> about her mother s demise . to help <SANSA STARK> remember how things used to be , <MYRANDA> leads <SANSA STARK> down to the kennels , where she finds <REEK> , formerly <THEON GREYJOY> , asleep in one of the cages . awoken by <SANSA STARK> s arrival , he just shakes his head , when <SANSA STARK> calls him <THEON GREYJOY> . he warns her that she shouldn't be down there . seeing <REEK> in such a pitiful condition , <SANSA STARK> angrily storms away .

in the throne room , daenerys ponders on what to do with tyrion and jorah . she asks tyrion why she shouldn't kill him , since the <LANNISTERS> are enemies to her house . he claims to have killed both of his parents and by that he is an enemy to the <LANNISTERS> as well . daenerys isn't convinced that killing one's own familiy is a good reputation for someone in her service . tyrion counters by wondering aloud if she at least is worth his service . ordered to tell her why he has come to her from the other end of the world , he explains how he learned about her own story from rumours and from <VARYS> . he says that she a lost girl born in a <STORM> , who with virtually no assistance managed to acquire a barbarian horde , an effective <ARMY> , <CONQUER> three cities , break the slave trade and hatch three dragons might be worth living for when he lost everything he had lived for until then . he adds that daenerys needs his advice despite having a powerful <ARMY> and large dragons , as she lacks both political experience and practical knowledge of <WESTEROS> . 
she eventually agrees to spare his life , but asks what to do about ser jorah . she seems poised to fulfil her promise of killing him if she saw him again , as it would not do at all for a queen not to <RED KEEP> her word . tyrion defends jorah , commenting that he is clearly devoted to her and quite possibly in love with her , but also that he did not trust her enough to inform her of his mission to spy on her for king robert and that therefore he can not be trusted to stand by her side . but , he argues , just as a queen should <RED KEEP> true to her oaths , she should also not kill those devoted to her . 
daenerys exiles jorah from the city . contemplating his greyscale , jorah returns to <YEZZAN> zo qaggaz and offers to fight for him . he promises to lead <YEZZAN>'s team to the great <PIT> and win the tournament for the queen after that <YEZZAN> can make a fortune selling jorah on the black market . 
later , tyrion and daenerys sit in her solar and have a talk about ambitions . when tyrion mentions what a horrible father tywin was , daenerys admits that she no longer has any illusions about her own father . daenerys is curious about the circumstances of tyrion's murder of tywin . he wryly promises that if she decides not to kill him then one day he will tell her , but on that day they will need a lot more wine than the large decanter they are drinking from . 
they discuss the role of <VARYS> in their stories and tyrion assures daenerys he trusts him , and that he's probably the reason she wasn't killed years ago . tyrion was convinced by <VARYS> that she could be a ruler who deserves his support . when daenerys asks how he can get her what she wants , tyrion nearly rolls his eyes at her desire for the <IRON THRONE> . he suggests that she might want to stay in <SLAVER>'s <BAY> and build a new kingdom for herself in <MEEREEN> , complimenting her on reopening the fighting pits and her upcoming political marriage . she assures him that she will stay and help stabilize things , and make sure the slave trade stays broken , but essos is not her <HOME> . tyrion counters that no one will support her in <WESTEROS> , but daenerys somewhat idealistically declares that the common people will support her . tyrion generously assumes that this will happen which it generally doesn't , but then he reminds daenerys that <MEEREEN> has been in a state of chaos without the combined support of the <GREAT MASTERS> and the smallfolk , and extends this to <WESTEROS> and its <GREAT HOUSES> . he notes that <GREAT HOUSES> targaryen and stark are effectively dead due to the combined actions of their two terrible fathers . neither <HOUSE LANNISTER> nor <HOUSE BARATHEON> of <DRAGONSTONE> will ever support her claim in <LIGHT> of their histories with the <TARGARYENS> . tyrion says that leaves <HOUSE TYRELL> who might be willing to switch sides due to cersei's recent schemes against them but that still isn't enough . daenerys stubbornly likens the <GREAT HOUSES> , including her own <HOUSE TARGARYEN> , to the spokes on a wheel , one on top and then others , and on and on , crushing the commoners beneath them in their struggle for supremacy . tyrion sarcastically warns that others have dreamed of stopping the wheel , but daenerys clarifies that she plans to break it . 
daenerys decides tyrion will remain as her advisor , but confiscates the wine , as a drunk is of no use to her . 
arya assumes the identity of <LANNA> , a clam seller , and shows jaqen jorah'ghar she can convincingly become a different person , developing an elaborate and very believable backstory . the faceless man sends her , as <LANNA> , to the harbor where she observes someone referred to as the <THIN MAN> refuse a contract to insure a <THIN MAN>'s boat , leaving the <THIN MAN> in desperate circumstances . jaqen explains the <THIN MAN>'s business is a sort of gamble yet he does not honor his agreements when a ship captain dies at sea , he is supposed to make good on his promise and pay the family , but he often doesn't . jaqen instructs her to kill him , and hands her a gift for the <THIN MAN> a vial of poison . the <WAIF> is skeptical of arya <LANNA>'s success . 
 <SEPTA UNELLA> continues to urge an imprisoned cersei to confess in return for her freedom . she remains defiant , despite being obliged to drink water from the floor out of sheer thirst . <QYBURN> visits her in her cell , and informs her that her trial will begin soon for the crimes of fornication , treason , incest , and robert's murder , all of which cersei furiously dismisses as lies . <QYBURN> tells her that <GRAND> maester <PYCELLE> has summoned <KEVAN> <HOUSE LANNISTER> to serve as <HAND> of the king . <KEVAN> has , at this point in time , already arrived , and he has refused to visit her in prison . <QYBURN> also tells her that <TOMMEN> has become reclusive , refusing to see anyone and refusing to eat in his emotional state . before leaving , he tells her the work continues on their secret project . 
a bitter and determined sansa confronts <REEK> about his latest betrayal . <REEK> apologetically affirms he was helping her and that there is no escaping ramsay . he tells her that <THEON GREYJOY> tried to escape but ramsay caught him and tortured him until there was no <THEON GREYJOY> left . sansa coldly expresses approval and reminds <REEK> of the role he played in her family's downfall , and that if she could do to him what ramsay did , she would . <REEK> shamefully admits he deserved his torture as he did terrible things , specifically killing those boys . enraged by his dismissive reference seemingly to her <BROTHERS> as those boys rather than bran and <RICKON> , sansa vehemently demands to know why they should be dead while he still breathes the air , forcing <REEK> to finally admit that they were not in fact bran and <RICKON> , only two farm boys . stunned by this admission , sansa's anger towards <REEK> cools but when she presses him as to where they might have gone , calling him <THEON GREYJOY> again , he breaks down and runs out the room , crying , not <THEON GREYJOY> <REEK> . 
 <ROOSE BOLTON> maintains that his <ARMY> must wait inside winterfell , thus starving out stannis' forces , as winterfell had enough supplies to last 6 months under <SIEGE> . such conditions would cause a mutiny in the ranks of the <HOUSE BARATHEON> force and break them down . ramsay , on the other <HAND> , has a plan to defeat stannis decisively and asks his father to lend him just 20 good <TOMMEN> . 
 <GILLY> continues to tend <SAM>'s wounds . <OLLY> enters with some food , having heard what happened . once <GILLY> leaves , <OLLY> expresses concern at joining forces with the <WILDLINGS> , particularly <TORMUND> , who led the raid in which his parents were killed . <SAM> reassures <OLLY> that jon knows what he is doing , and that unless he is successful , neither the night's watch nor <WESTEROS> stands a chance against the <WHITE WALKERS> . <SAM> explains this is a hard choice jon had to make , however unpopular , and then tells him not to worry , as jon always comes back . 
 <JON SNOW> and <TORMUND> giantsbane , along with other members of the night's watch and the <FREE FOLK> , arrive at the wildling <TOWN> <HARDHOME> to convince the rest of the <WILDLINGS> to join them in the upcoming war against the <WHITE WALKERS> and their armies of wights . 
insisting on never being an ally with a crow , the lord of bones insults <TORMUND> for being at the side of an enemy like <JON SNOW> . <TORMUND> seizes the lord's staff and beats his former ally to death with it . the wildling elders decide to gather in the townshall to hear out <JON SNOW>'s proposal an alliance between the <FREE FOLK> and the night's watch in the face of their common enemy , the undead . 
having not seen <MANCE RAYDER> since he was taken prisoner at the wall , the <WILDLINGS> question his whereabouts . <JON SNOW> reluctantly informs them that he is dead and that he shot him personally with an arrow . the group is infuriated , but as they move in to kill him , <TORMUND> vouches for him , describing how <MANCE RAYDER> was about to be burned at the stake as a warning from <STANNIS BARATHEON> , and how <JON SNOW> defied <STANNIS BARATHEON> by ending his life quickly instead of humiliating him and making him suffer in the flames . some leaders are convinced , such as <KARSI> and the giant wun wun , but others like the <THENN> warrior <LOBODA> begin to leave . <JON SNOW> offers them the dragonglass daggers , telling them that his friend had killed a <WHITE WALKERS> walker with one . the <WILDLINGS> still seem unconvinced . 
while approximately five thousand <FREE FOLK> gather to set sail to the wall , the night's watch starts gathering the dragonglass daggers in the tent . edd approaches wun wun who holds one of the daggers , examining it curiously . the giant appears unwilling to <HAND> it over and asks edd the <FUCK> you looking at in the giants' rudimentary form of the old tongue . edd walks away quietly , without collecting the arrowhead . suddenly , dogs begin barking and the sounds of a <STORM> are heard . recognizing the sign of approaching <WHITE WALKERS> , <LOBODA> orders the gates of <HARDHOME> to be shut , abandoning many of the <FREE FOLK> on the other side to their fate . as the <STORM> reaches the village , the screams of the people shut <OUTSIDE> the walls of <HARDHOME> quickly fall silent . a moment later , a large host of undead wights begin breaking through the gates and climbing over the walls . <JON SNOW> , <TORMUND> , <LOBODA> and <KARSI> fight alongside others to give as many people as possible an opportunity to make it to their ships . <EDDISON> tollett , wun wun , and others are trapped inside the townhall , which is set upon by wights and catches fire in the confusion , the bag of dragonglass weapons is lost . 
the night king raises the dead <WILDLINGS> into wights . 
on top of a hill overlooking <HARDHOME> , several <WHITE WALKERS> mounted on undead horses observe the <BATTLE> , including the night king . noticing them , and realizing the need for dragonglass , <JON SNOW> and <LOBODA> go to the burning townhall , only to be confronted by a <WHITE WALKERS> walker warrior . while <LOBODA> faces the threat , <JON SNOW> goes for the dragonglass . <LOBODA> is quickly killed after his axe shatters immediately upon contacting the <WHITE WALKERS> walker's <ICE> blade . <JON SNOW> just manages to grab a dragonglass dagger but is tossed aside by the <WHITE WALKERS> walker . <JON SNOW> retrieves <LONGCLAW> and defends himself against the <WHITE WALKERS> walker and both combatants are astonished to see the <VALYRIAN> steel remain intact after colliding with the <WHITE WALKERS> walker's blade . seizing the opportunity , <JON SNOW> strikes the <WHITE WALKERS> walker , shattering his body into fragments of <ICE> , confirming that <VALYRIAN> steel is just as lethal to them as dragonglass . the night king , watching the entire <BATTLE> from a distance , seems at least mildly intrigued by this turn of events . 
meanwhile , <KARSI> fights off multiple wights before being confronted by a pack of undead children . frozen by the horror , she is unable to resist as she is mauled to death . the <WHITE WALKERS> deploy another large host of wights , letting them hurl themselves over the cliffs above <HARDHOME> . <JON SNOW> , edd , <TORMUND> and the remaining defenders flee for their lives . shielded by wun wun , who throws several wights off himself and wields a burning log as a club before walking into the sea with them , they manage to get to the last remaining boat and quickly row out to a safe distance . as <JON SNOW> and the others look on in horror , the night king raises his arms triumphantly all around it , the slain <WILDLINGS> rise up as undead wights , including <KARSI> . the night king and his <ARMY> continue to stare in silence as they retreat .

 <JON SNOW> watches <WILDLINGS> enter inside <CASTLE BLACK> . 
 <JON SNOW> , <TORMUND> , and the surviving few thousand <WILDLINGS> from <HARDHOME> arrive at the wall , before the gates of <CASTLE BLACK> . for a tense moment ser <ALLISER THORNE> hesitates to let all of their old enemies through , but finally he gives the order to open the gate . thousands of <WILDLINGS> come through the wall to <CASTLE BLACK> itself , including many women and children , and even the giant wun wun . many <TOMMEN> of the night's watch glare at them . <ALLISER THORNE> coolly says to <JON SNOW> that he has a good heart to save so many people , but that it may end up getting them all killed . 
 <JON SNOW> reunites with <SAMWELL TARLY> , but is despondent , saying that the mission was a disaster and they only managed to save a small fraction of the <WILDLINGS> at <HARDHOME> . <SAM> points to different <WILDLINGS> passing by and notes that each of them would have died if he had done nothing at all , so it wasn't a complete failure . 
i . 
during the night at <STANNIS BARATHEON>'s <ARMY> camp , <MELISANDRE> gazes intently into the flames of her tent's brazier hoping to receive visions from the lord of <LIGHT> . in the distance , several tents burst into flames , sending confused <TOMMEN> shouting , and one horse screams as he runs away on fire . during the night , <RAMSAY BOLTON> and twenty <TOMMEN> raided the camp , burning much of their food supplies and heavy <SIEGE> weapons . hundreds of horses also died in the fire . <DAVOS> notes that their situation is now dire they don't have enough food to make the march back to <CASTLE BLACK> or to advance to winterfell , and without their <SIEGE> weapons they have little chance of storming the <CASTLE BLACK> to take its food supplies anyway . <STANNIS BARATHEON> asks how this could happen and <DAVOS> insists that the <BOLTONS> know the north's terrain better than they do so it was easy for a raiding party to sneak into camp . <STANNIS BARATHEON> suggests that the watchmen were either collaborating with the enemy or simply not attentive enough at their posts to allow such a disaster either way he orders them to be executed . <STANNIS BARATHEON> says to slaughter the dead horses for their meat , which should at least buy them a little time . 
 <STANNIS BARATHEON>'s demeanor becomes grave and half stunned , as he believes there is only one course of action to take . he starts by ordering <DAVOS> to return to <CASTLE BLACK> to ask for more supplies from <JON SNOW> . <DAVOS> is confused given that even if <JON SNOW> did decide to resupply them the provisions probably wouldn't reach them in time , and wonders why <STANNIS BARATHEON> would send him instead of just a messenger . <STANNIS BARATHEON> insists that it is because he needs his <HAND> of the king to engage in diplomacy to win <JON SNOW> over but in reality , <STANNIS BARATHEON> sends <DAVOS> away so he wouldn't be around to stop what <STANNIS BARATHEON> was planning on doing next . 
 <DAVOS> visits the tent of <STANNIS BARATHEON>'s daughter <SHIREEN> <STANNIS BARATHEON> to say goodbye . she is enjoying reading a book by <GRAND> maester munkun about the dance of the dragons , a major civil war in the history of the <SEVEN KINGDOMS> . they share a laugh about how a knight tried to kill the dragon vhagar by sneaking up on it with a mirrored shield , but it didn't fool the dragon , who promptly roasted the knight . <DAVOS> gives her a wooden stag figurine he has been carving as a present . she asks why he has been so nice to her , and he explains that he felt bad that his son <MATTHOS> always insisted that his father learn to read and he never did . <MATTHOS> died in the war , and by teaching <DAVOS> to read <SHIREEN> helped him fulfill his son's wish . 
some time after <DAVOS> leaves , <STANNIS BARATHEON> himself visits <SHIREEN> , visibly shaken but trying to speak to her kindly . he asks about her reading , and she explains that the dance of the dragons was a great civil war between <RHAENYRA> targaryen and her half brother <AEGON> , each of whom thought they deserved to sit on the <IRON THRONE> . the great lords of the <SEVEN KINGDOMS> each declared for one or the other , dividing the <REALM> in half , and tearing <WESTEROS> apart . brother fought brother and dragon fought dragon in the devastating war . it was a disaster for <HOUSE TARGARYEN> as well , who never truly recovered . <STANNIS BARATHEON> asks who she would have chosen , <RHAENYRA> or <AEGON> , and she says she wouldn't have chosen either it was all of the choosing sides that plunged <WESTEROS> into civil war . <STANNIS BARATHEON> gravely responds that sometimes the world forces a man to choose even if he doesn't want to , but if he stays true to himself he knows what he must do , and then it isn't really a choice at all even if he hates doing it . <SHIREEN> says it's all right and she wants to help him , though he responds that she doesn't even know what he wants . she doesn't care and asks if there is any way she can help , and he says that there is . <SHIREEN> insists that she wants to , because she is princess <SHIREEN> of <HOUSE BARATHEON> , his daughter . they hug and he embraces her tightly and <STANNIS BARATHEON> whispers forgive me . 
later , <SHIREEN> exits her tent as well and sees all of the soldiers gathered around , and asks where her father is . coming to the front of the assembly , she sees <MELISANDRE> in front of a wooden pyre with a large stake in the middle . she starts shouting to see her father , but is grabbed by soldiers who drag her to the pyre and tie her to the stake . <MELISANDRE> soothingly tries to calm her by saying that it will all be over soon . <SHIREEN>'s cries ring out through the camp , but no one intervenes . <STANNIS BARATHEON> and <SHIREEN>'s mother <SELYSE> then appear in the crowd . <SHIREEN> sees them and begs her mother and father to help , but they do nothing . <SELYSE> insists aloud to herself that the sacrifice is what the lord of <LIGHT> wants . 
 <STANNIS BARATHEON> watches as <SHIREEN> is sacrificed . 
 <MELISANDRE> begins praying and announces that they offer up the life of this girl to the lord of <LIGHT> , and sets the pyre on fire . as she explained to <STANNIS BARATHEON> before , she believes that sacrificing <SHIREEN>'s life which contains the power of a king's blood will gain the lord of <LIGHT>'s favor , who in return will aid them in their time of need by lifting the blizzard . <STANNIS BARATHEON> believes that if they do nothing , they will remain snowbound and all starve to death here . <SHIREEN> continues to repeatedly cry mother , please and father , please eventually even <SELYSE> , who only had a cold and non existent relationship with her daughter , suddenly breaks and rushes forward , begging that they can't go through with it . soldiers restrain her , however , and she sinks to the ground crying in despair . <SHIREEN>'s cries become even more frightened , but <STANNIS BARATHEON> continues to watch even as <SELYSE> sobs on the ground . as the flames begin to consume <SHIREEN> she wordlessly screams in pain and fear , and eventually even <STANNIS BARATHEON> can not bear to look anymore as she burns to death . 
i . 
jaime sits and speaks with <DORAN> . 
 <JAIME LANNISTER> is escorted into the main apartments of the <WATER GARDENS> by <AREO> <HOTAH> , to be received by prince <DORAN> martell in a luxurious solar , along with <ELLARIA SAND> , <DORAN>'s son <TRYSTANE MARTELL> , and <JAIME LANNISTER>'s niece myrcella <STANNIS BARATHEON> . they lounge on a circle of couches , myrcella cuddling with <TRYSTANE MARTELL> . <JAIME LANNISTER> notes that myrcella is wearing a revealing <DORNISH> style dress now , and she says that the warm climate of <DORNE> agrees with her . 
coming to the point , <DORAN> asks <JAIME LANNISTER> why he has snuck in to <DORNE> to abduct myrcella back to king's <LANDING> . he says he feared for her safety , but when <DORAN> insists why he didn't just send a letter by messenger raven , he explains that they received a threatening message myrcella's <JAIME LANNISTER> lion pendant jammed in the mouth of dead viper . <DORAN> glares at <ELLARIA SAND> , while a confused myrcella explains that her pendant was simply stolen from her room . 
 <JAIME LANNISTER> asks if <DORAN> intends to behead him , but acting more sympathetic now that <JAIME LANNISTER> revealed he was threatened first he says that he will not , because he wishes to avoid war . he has seen what war can do , bodies piled on the battlefield and orphans left starving in cities at <HARDHOME> , and he will not lead his people into that . <ELLARIA SAND> bluntly asks what he will do , break bread with the <LANNISTERS> however he says that is precisely what he will do , as wine is poured for <JAIME LANNISTER> , and he raises his own goblet and offers a toast to king <TOMMEN> , first of his name , long may he reign . <JAIME LANNISTER> returns the toast but <ELLARIA SAND> deliberately pours out her wine onto the floor in disgust . 
 <DORAN> asks if <TOMMEN> indeed commands that his sister be returned to the capital , and <JAIME LANNISTER> politely says he does , to which <DORAN> says he can not disobey his king myrcella will return to king's <LANDING> . she is upset for a moment , but then <DORAN> explains his solution his son <TRYSTANE MARTELL> will go along with them , to take over the seat on the <SMALL COUNCIL> which tywin granted to <OBERYN> , but which was vacated by his death . <DORAN> insists that for the alliance between the <IRON THRONE> and <DORNE> to continue , the engagement of <TRYSTANE MARTELL> and myrcella must stand , and <TRYSTANE MARTELL> will simply take his uncle <OBERYN>'s place on the <SMALL COUNCIL> . <JAIME LANNISTER> finds <DORAN>'s request entirely reasonable , and myrcella is ecstatic that she will not be separated from <TRYSTANE MARTELL> , so <JAIME LANNISTER> agrees . <ELLARIA SAND> gets up to leave and snaps that it is no wonder that <DORAN> can not stand , because he has no spine . as she walks out he grabs her by the arm and lowers his voice , saying that she is the mother of four of his nieces and for their sake he hopes she has a long and happy life but if she talks to him that way again , she will not . 
 <JAIME LANNISTER> then asks what fate will befall bronn , who is still imprisoned . bronn punched out <TRYSTANE MARTELL> when they tried to take myrcella , and <JAIME LANNISTER> is asked what the normal punishment is for striking a prince where he is from . <JAIME LANNISTER> politely insists that bronn was only following orders and they can't punish him for simply following <JAIME LANNISTER>'s commands . <TRYSTANE MARTELL> agrees , saying he has learned the value of mercy from his father , but that he has one condition . 
in the prison cells , <NYMERIA> and <TYENE> <ELLARIA SAND> spar out of boredom , as <OBARA> tries to ignore them and get some sleep . the guards arrive and release bronn , and <TYENE> mocks him as he leaves . <AREO> leads bronn back to the solar where <DORAN> , <JAIME LANNISTER> , and the rest remain . bronn apologizes to <TRYSTANE MARTELL> when he sees him and says he didn't mean anything by hitting him before . <JAIME LANNISTER> then gladly informs bronn that the martells agreed to let bronn go with <JAIME LANNISTER> , but on one condition wordlessly , <AREO> then delivers it by striking bronn in the face with his elbow , the large guard captain hitting him so hard that he is knocked to the floor . thus his debt to <TRYSTANE MARTELL> is settled . 
later , in the courtyard , <AREO> brings <ELLARIA SAND> and the <SAND SNAKES> before prince <DORAN> in his wheelchair . <DORAN> gives <ELLARIA SAND> an ultimatum she can either choose to swear allegiance to him and that she will not try something like this again , or she can choose death . restraining tears , she kneels and kisses his <HAND> . <DORAN> says that he believes in second chances and she is forgiven but sternly warns her that he does not believe in third chances . 
 <ELLARIA SAND> then finds <JAIME LANNISTER> in a study writing a letter back to king's <LANDING> informing of his return . he writes very poorly , given that he is using his non dominant left <HAND> , and <ELLARIA SAND> remarks that he writes like a <SEVEN KINGDOMS> year old . <ELLARIA SAND> notes how odd it is that she and <OBERYN> were looked down on for their sexuality in king's <LANDING> , and <JAIME LANNISTER> is scorned for his incestuous love for cersei to which he remains silent and gives no acknowledgement though a hundred years ago , if his name were <HOUSE TARGARYEN> , no one would have blinked an eye at such a relationship . cryptically perhaps spurred by <DORAN> , she then says that she knows your daughter myrcella had no part in what befell <OBERYN> , and maybe even <JAIME LANNISTER> is innocent of that and indeed he is , as <OBERYN> volunteered for the trial by combat . she exits , and <JAIME LANNISTER> is left to ponder what seems to be her apology . 
i . 
arya , or <LANNA> , sells oysters , clams , and cockles on the canal streets . 
arya , in her <LANNA> persona , is once again pushing her cart through the canal streets of <BRAAVOS> selling oysters , clams , and cockles . she passes the <THIN MAN> who sells insurance to sailors , having been given a mission by the <FACELESS MEN> to assassinate him with poisoned oysters . just as she reaches him , however , she stops in her tracks and stares fixedly on a boat at the dock which has caught her full attention . stepping out of the boat is master of coin <MACE> tyrell and the commander of his guards is none other than ser <MERYN TRANT> of the <KINGSGUARD> , one of the names on arya's kill list which she recites as a daily prayer . <MERYN TRANT> helped betray her father and killed her <WATER GARDENS> dancing trainer <SYRIO FOREL> . <MACE> was sent by <CERSEI LANNISTER> to treat with the <IRON BANK> of <BRAAVOS> , which has started calling in the crown's massive debts , and at least try to gain a little more time to deal with the problem from the bankers . <MACE> is greeted at the dock by the <IRON BANK>'s representative , <TYCHO> nestoris . <MACE> addresses <TYCHO> politely and amiably , though he doesn't realize that his jokes aren't really funny . all the while arya remains frozen and staring at ser <MERYN TRANT> , ignoring the <THIN MAN>'s requests for some of her oysters . 
arya abandons her mission to assassinate the <THIN MAN> , and instead follows ser <MERYN TRANT> as he accompanies <MACE> . after visiting the <IRON BANK> building , <MERYN TRANT> and a few other <CERSEI LANNISTER> guards depart from <MACE> at night and go to visit a local brothel . arya sneaks into the brothel under the guise of simply selling her oysters and clams from a <HAND> basket . the bouncer brusco doesn't want her in at first but the prostitute lhara , who is one of arya's regular customers , tells him to let her stay , as oysters are held to be an aphrodisiac . arya sells a few and then makes her way to the back chambers where she spies on <MERYN TRANT> from behind some shutters . <MERYN TRANT> catches a brief look at her at one point , and she seems vaguely familiar , but he just shrugs it off it has been years since he last saw her , she is older and thus looks different , she has different <BRAAVOSI> style hair and clothes , and he doesn't think that arya would logically be in <BRAAVOS> . 
the brothel's madam presents several girls in succession to <MERYN TRANT> , but he passes on each as too old . she brings out her best and most expensive prostitute , a beautiful young woman named anara , but <MERYN TRANT> again dismisses her as too old . the madam slowly realizes that <MERYN TRANT> is perversely interested in young girls who are barely teenagers around arya's age so she brings out a very young girl who <MERYN TRANT> accepts gruffly , bluntly saying he expects another fresh one tomorrow . after he leaves the madam runs into arya and shoos her out . 
later , arya returns to the <HOUSE TARGARYEN> of black and white empty handed , having abandoned her first mission for the <FACELESS MEN> . when jaqen h'ghar asks what happened , she lies to him and says that the <THIN MAN> simply wasn't hungry today and didn't order any of her oysters . jaqen quips that perhaps this is why he is a <THIN MAN> , and arya promises that she will follow through on the assassination tomorrow . she departs , and while jaqen seems to suspect that she was lying , he makes no outward reaction to it . 
i . 
 <DANY> claps to start the fights . 
attended by <TYRION LANNISTER> , <MISSANDEI> , and <DAARIO> <NAHARIS> , daenerys sits in the royal box at the daznak's <PIT> . <HIZDAHR> zo <LORAQ> arrives late , claiming to have been putting the final touches on the arrangements for the event . when the first two combatants take the field , <HIZDAHR> indicates that daenerys is to start the fight with a clap of her hands . <DAARIO> verbally spars with <HIZDAHR> for much of the first match , drawing daenerys's attention from the spectacle in front of her . her attention returns to the arena when <JORAH MORMONT> gives the traditional dedication to her . in spite of <JORAH MORMONT>'s previous successes , he has decidedly mixed results in the <GRAND> melee he finds himself in . the <GRAND> melee begins with six fighters , with <JORAH MORMONT> pairing up against a <NORVOSI> long axe fighter . the <NORVOSI> is able to land several blows against <JORAH MORMONT> , eventually knocking him to the ground , however <JORAH MORMONT> is able to bring out his dagger and eventually bury it into the <NORVOSI>'s chest after a brief melee . .

at <BALON GREYJOY>'s funeral , <YARA> tells the priest , <AERON> <BALON GREYJOY> , <BALON GREYJOY>'s youngest brother , that she will find the person who did this and feed them to sharks while they're still alive . she swears to do this upon the <SALT THRONE> and <AERON> explains to her that she isn't the ruler yet , because the law says that the kingsmoot chooses the next ruler . <YARA> argues that her father wanted her to rule , but <AERON> says that he doesn't make the law .

 <ALLISER THORNE> , plus <OLLY> and the officers who mutinied alongside him , are led away to the <ICE> cells . as <TORMUND> inspects jon's corpse , <DAVOS> visits <MELISANDRE> , who has donned her normal glamor but is still gripped by a crisis of faith . when he asks her if reviving jon is possible , she admits to having seen it done , but insists that she can not do it , having lost faith in the lord of <LIGHT> due to the failure of her predictions regarding <STANNIS BARATHEON> to come true . after <DAVOS> implores her simply to try , she agrees . after washing jon's wounds clean and burning his hair , she attempts to revive him using murmured <HIGH SPARROW> <VALYRIAN> incantations , but it seems they have no effect . after a moment , <TORMUND> leaves , and <MELISANDRE> offers a final please in the common tongue , but leaves the room , despondent . edd and finally <DAVOS> follow her a moment later . once the room is empty however , ghost , who had been sleeping underneath the table upon which jon was lying , perks up , and jon suddenly awakens , gasping for air .

 <VARYS> , <TYRION LANNISTER> and <MISSANDEI> converge to prepare for their meeting . 
in their meeting chambers , <YEZZAN> marvels at how <TYRION LANNISTER> went from being a nearly worthless slave to the de facto ruler of <MEEREEN> . the slave trading cities offer to give <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> and her mercenaries a large pot of money if they sail away from <SLAVER>'s <BAY> . when <MISSANDEI> defends <DAENERYS TARGARYEN>'s actions in liberating slaves , <RAZDAL> contends that slavery has existed for centuries . after hearing their offer , <TYRION LANNISTER> proposes a counter offer . he offers to give them a seven year grace period to phase out slavery and to compensate slave owners , however they must end all backing for the sons of the harpy regardless of whether they admit this backing or not . he then cautions them that they will not get a better offer . <TYRION LANNISTER> then gives them time to consider his offer , though <GREY WORM> and <MISSANDEI> insist on abolishing slavery . 
 <TYRION LANNISTER> and his entourage are later confronted by a crowd of former slaves in the <MEEREEN> throne room . a freedman demands to know when <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> will return while another is appalled at the idea of <TYRION LANNISTER> negotiating with slave traders . <TYRION LANNISTER> insists he is doing his best to rule the city in <DAENERYS TARGARYEN>'s absence . the freedmen do not trust <TYRION LANNISTER> , a foreigner and a newcomer , and look to <GREY WORM> and <MISSANDEI> for reassurance . despite their misgivings , they both publicly back <TYRION LANNISTER>'s diplomacy in front of the freedmen . in private , <GREY WORM> and <MISSANDEI> warn <TYRION LANNISTER> that the <WISE MASTERS> will outmaneuver him , despite his best efforts to do the same to them . 
i . 
ser <JORAH MORMONT> and <DAARIO> <NAHARIS> approach the outskirts of <VAES DOTHRAK> and discard their weapons , as drawing a blade in the city is considered sacrilege . within the city itself , <JORAH MORMONT> and <DAARIO> run afoul of <AKHO> and <IGGO> who see through <JORAH MORMONT>'s claims to be a wine merchant . <DAARIO> takes care of <IGGO> while <AKHO> tackles <JORAH MORMONT> . the knight is nearly undone , but <DAARIO> saves him at the last minute with the stiletto he smuggled in . at <JORAH MORMONT>'s insistence , <DAARIO> smashes aggo's skull with a rock so that no one will think he was killed with a bladed weapon . 
 <DANY> proves to the dothraki who their true khaleesi is . 
meanwhile , the high priestess of the <DOSH KHALEEN> gives <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> a commentary on the other crones . some of them hate <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> , thinking the dothraki should not interbreed with other races , but the high priestess dismisses them , saying that the dothraki have always interbred and have never been concerned with blood purity . to illustrate her point , the high priestess indicates another of the <DOSH KHALEEN> , a <LHAZAREEN> girl <ORNELA> taken from her village at the age of twelve . <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> asks to relieve herself , and the high priestess sends <ORNELA> with her . as they walk , <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> learns that <ORNELA>'s khal died when she was only sixteen . the pair are interrupted by <JORAH MORMONT> and <DAARIO> , who take the <LHAZAREEN> hostage . <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> , unsurprised to see them , cancels their plans for escape they have a slim chance of leaving <VAES DOTHRAK> , let alone getting back to <MEEREEN> and tells them that she has a plan of her own . she asks <ORNELA> if she is willing to help them , calling her a khaleesi queen instead of a <DOSH KHALEEN> crone . the girl reluctantly agrees . 
during the khalar vezhven , the khals argue about how to deal with <IGGO> and <AKHO>'s deaths <KHAL MORO> defuses the situation by reminding them that ahko was a member of his khalasar , and he does not care about finding the killer if he was stupid enough to get himself killed . <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> is then brought in by the two priestesses she befriended before . <KHAL MORO> insists that she join the <DOSH KHALEEN> , but another <KHAL MORO> expresses interest in making her his khaleesi , while another suggests giving her to the <WISE MASTERS> in exchange for ten thousand horses . <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> dismisses all of them she claims that they are all petty and weak , and reminds them that <KHAL DROGO> was willing to cross the poison water in wooden horses for his conquests . 
 <JORAH MORMONT> and <DAARIO> bow down to their queen . 
stating that none of the khals is fit to lead the dothraki , <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> declares that she will lead them herself . after a pause , <KHAL MORO> and the khals burst into laughter . <DANY> reminds them that her husband , in the same temple in which they all now sit , declared that he would lead a dothraki <ARMY> across the <NARROW SEA> to retake the <IRON THRONE> for his khaleesi and that all the khals have done since is to raid and plunder villages in lieu of any meaningful conquest . disgusted with her insolence , <KHAL MORO> declares that she will be raped by each of the khals , then by all of their bloodriders , and then , if she is still alive , by their horses . <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> is unfazed by the threats , as she knocks down the braziers in the hut , setting everything aflame . the khals desperately attempt to escape the rapidly spreading fire , only to find the temple's only door barred , the bodies of the two men guarding it lying dead <OUTSIDE> . 
as the flames climb higher , the <DOSH KHALEEN> and khalasars gather in confusion . eventually , the doors collapse and <DAENERYS TARGARYEN> emerges , naked and unburned , with the entire leadership present at <VAES DOTHRAK> dead . many of the assembled bow immediately , with the high priestess and the rest of the <DOSH KHALEEN> following after a moment . <JORAH MORMONT> and <DAARIO> move to the front of the crowd and bow last .

the three eyed raven shows bran a vision of a heart tree amid spirals of standing stones in a lush green valley . his vision shows <LEAF> and other children of the <FOREST> talking amongst themselves , then looking eagerly at a captive bound to the tree . <LEAF> approaches and forces a dragonglass dagger into the captive's chest . the captive screams , but does not die , instead becoming the first white walker . 
bran immediately confronts <LEAF> about creating the <WHITE WALKERS> in the first place . <LEAF> tries to explain that they were at war with the <FIRST MEN> and were desperate . later , bran is the only one in the cave awake and is anxious to warg back into the <WEIRWOOD> tree . bran wargs into the tree by himself and sees the <ARMY> of the dead . he slowly walks through the <ARMY> until he comes to a space occupied by four <WHITE WALKERS> , including the night king . as bran becomes aware that the the night king and the dead are now able to see him , the night king grabs his arm , branding him with an icy mark . he breaks out of the vision with a scream waking the others . the three eyed raven tells bran , <MEERA> and <HODOR> that the night king is now able to locate bran and able to bypass the powerful magic keeping the <WHITE WALKERS> and the wights out of the cave . as a result , they must leave now and bran must become the three eyed raven . bran asks whether he is ready , and the raven says no at which point bran's eyes whiten as he enters another vision . 
as <MEERA> and <HODOR> are preparing to leave they notice the air is so cold their breath is visible , indicating the arrival of the <ARMY> of the dead <OUTSIDE> of the cave . the night king and three <WHITE WALKERS> start marching towards the cave . the children of the <FOREST> try using magic projectiles to fend the <WHITE WALKERS> off , but are overwhelmed . they <LIGHT> a fire around the entrance which prevents the wights from entering but the <WHITE WALKERS> extinguish a pathway and walk through . the wights end up climbing over the <WEIRWOOD> and dropping through roots at the top of the cave . <MEERA> desperately tries to get bran out of the vision and attempts to get the frightened <HODOR> to carry bran away to no avail . using a dragonglass tipped spear , <MEERA> kills the <FIRST MEN> <WHITE WALKERS> walker that enters , and fights alongside the remaining children of the <FOREST> to try to fend off the wights until bran wakes up . wights begin to swarm the cave , killing all of the children of the <FOREST> except for <LEAF> , as <MEERA> starts yelling at bran to warg into <HODOR> . 
in the vision , bran is at winterfell watching <NED STARK> say goodbye to his father , rickard <NED STARK> , before being sent to the <VALE> as a ward . while still in the vision , bran hears <MEERA>'s cries to warg into <HODOR> and the three eyed raven tells him to listen to her . bran wargs into both the present day <HODOR> in the cave and <WYLIS> , the young version of <HODOR> in his vision . 
 <WYLIS> seizing , as his words <HOLD> the door evolve into <HODOR> . 
the <HODOR> in the cave puts bran's body on a sled and starts hauling him down a tunnel leading out of the cave with <LEAF> and <MEERA> , as bran's direwolf <SUMMER> is killed attacking the wights . as the wights are closing in on them , <LEAF> sacrifices herself , using magic to cause a huge explosion , buying the other three enough time to get to a door at the end of the tunnel . while the three eyed raven and bran are still sharing a vision , the night king kills the three eyed raven , and his figure within bran's vision blows away as ashes and rags . 
with some difficulty <HODOR> pushes the door open and pulls bran through , coming back to help <MEERA> close the door just as the wights approach . <MEERA> grabs bran's sled and tells <HODOR> to bar the exit , shouting to <HOLD> the door . inside bran's vision , <WYLIS> notices bran , who links the present <HODOR> to the past <WYLIS> . <WYLIS> begins to seize when he enters the mind of his future self . as <MEERA> continues to yell <HOLD> the door to present day <HODOR> , within bran's vision <WYLIS> falls to the ground convulsing and starts repeating this same sentence in the midst of his seizure . eventually , <HOLD> the door slurs into <HODOR> , as his condition deteriorates and it becomes apparent this is the moment <HODOR> lost the ability to say any other words , and his destiny was fixed . 
present day <HODOR> braces himself against the door long enough for <MEERA> to disappear into the snow with bran's unconscious body on the sled . inevitably , the wights break through parts of the <WEIRWOOD> and begin scratching and stabbing a visibly distressed <HODOR> . with no possibility of escape , all that is shown at the end is young <WYLIS> in the past seizing and crying out <HODOR> .
