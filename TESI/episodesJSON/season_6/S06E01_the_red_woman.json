Sansa and Theon race the cold and the hounds.","summary":[{"location":"In the North","content":"Brienne and Podrick meet Sansa and Theon.  \nRamsay and Maester Wolkan attend to the dead body of Myranda. Ramsay remembers the first time he met her, stating that while other people were afraid of him, she wasn't. The Maester asks if they should bury her or construct a funeral pyre. Ramsay says she is good meat and they should feed her to the hounds.\nTheon and Sansa, having survived the fall from Winterfell's wall, run through the Wolfswood realizing there are already men with hounds chasing them. Theon tries to hide their scent by crossing a river. Guiding a frightened Sansa, they make it across and hide by a fallen tree with Theon hugging Sansa to try to keep her warm. Hearing the dogs still after them, Theon tries to lead them away, telling Sansa to keep heading north for Jon and Castle Black. A group of Bolton men sent by Ramsay, with the Bastard's Girls, find them. Theon claims Sansa was hurt when they jumped and he left her to die, but the dogs find her. The leader mocks Theon over what Ramsay will do to him now and prepares to bring them back to Winterfell. Brienne and Podrick arrive and a fight begins. Brienne kills most of them while Podrick displays the techniques she taught him, managing to kill one. He is then attacked by another and briefly holds his own before being knocked down but Theon grabs a sword and kills the Bolton man. Sansa accepts Brienne into her service. Where they go next is uncertain.\nRoose Bolton meets with Ramsay afterwards and asks if preemptively assaulting the struggling army of Stannis Baratheon makes him feel like a winner now that they've lost Sansa. A Lannister army marching north could easily overwhelm the Bolton troops at Winterfell and the Dreadfort. Ramsay assures his father they will recapture Sansa as he's sent his best men to find her. Roose continues that they need her to rally the north against the Lannisters, if need be, and subtly warns Ramsay that if he fails to recapture her, his unborn brother will become his heir."},{"location":"In Braavos","content":"In Braavos, Arya faces The Waif  \nArya is blind and asks for money in the streets, when the Waif approaches her with two fighting sticks, and gives her one.

Varys intercedes, explaining to the woman the money is so the baby can eat. The relieved woman accepts Tyrion's generosity.\nAs they keep walking through the city, Tyrion states that they need to find the leader of the Sons of the Harpy in order to bring peace to Meereen. Varys said that his spies have been sent all over the city, and that soon they will bring him information. Their conversation is interrupted by a crowd of screaming people running from a huge cloud of smoke.

As he lies on the floor, his guards do nothing, indicating they have sided with Ellaria.

As he is gasping, Doran begs Ellaria to spare Trystane, but Ellaria coldly scoffs at him. Doran then dies in a pool of his own blood."},{"location":"In King's Landing","content":"Myrcella's corpse arrives from Dorne.  \nCersei is sitting alone in her room, when a servant enters and announces that a ship from Dorne has arrived.

Ghost is scratching at the door in grief and howling, which gets the attention of several people, including Davos, who leaves his room to investigate. Ser Davos finds Jon's dead body just before Edd and some other brothers arrive. They take the body inside where Edd clears a table and angrily curses Thorne after closing Jon's eyes. Davos asks if Edd trusts any of his brothers, and Edd replies, \"The ones in this room.\" Davos convinces Edd to go bring Ghost in, deciding that they need all the help they can get. Melisandre arrives, stating she saw Jon fighting in Winterfell in the flames. Davos and the black brothers doubt the dead Lord Commander could do such a thing and she returns to her room.\nAlliser Thorne, Othell Yarwyck, and Bowen Marsh hold a meeting with the remaining black brothers stationed at Castle Black and explain their reasoning for killing the Lord Commander. Most of the brothers come to understand them and side with the mutineers. Back inside the room, Davos notes Thorne is sure to have made his move by now. In response, Edd states he doesn't care because Jon was his friend and they butchered him, then he rallies the loyal brothers to try and take out Thorne in revenge. Davos responds they are hopelessly outnumbered, stating Ghost isn't enough when Edd brings him up, before reminding them there are others nearby who owe Jon their lives. Realizing he means the Wildlings, Edd instructs them to bar the door and not let anyone in while he sneaks out to get help.\nAll members of the Watch are shown bearing arms toward the room where Jon's body is being guarded by Ser Davos and the men loyal to Jon Snow. Thorne and senior members of the Watch approach the room and Thorne speaks to Ser Davos through the locked door. Thorne promises full amnesty for the members of the Watch. To Ser Davos he offers a fresh horse and safe passage to ride south or in any direction he wishes, and that he can take Melisandre with him. Ser Davos mocks what he knows to be an insincere offer by requesting mutton. Ser Davos tells Thorne he is a poor hunter and does not want to starve, so he needs some mutton for his trip. Thorne promises him food will be provided. Ser Thorne says the offer is available as long as everyone in the room surrenders, and does so by sundown.\n\n    Melisandre without her magical glamor of youth.  \nAlone in her bedroom, Melisandre appears despondent and looking as if she has been betrayed or led astray by The Lord of Light. On a table next to her bed are various containers, some small that contain potions and other liquids. She unbuttons the front of her dress showing a young beautiful body. She then removes the dress completely and stands nude before a mirror. When she removes her large necklace the gem loses its glow. In the mirror, Melisandre's reflections shows she has transformed or morphed back to a 400-year-old woman she has been said to be, a frail old woman with sagging breasts, leathery skin and thin wispy white hair. Fully nude, with her head bowed down in a despondent manner, she slowly climbs into bed and pulls the fur blanket on top of her."}],"firsts":["Maester Caleotte","Akho","Qhono","Khal Moro","Bolton Officer","Khal Moro's 1st wife","Khal Moro's 2nd wife","Zanrush"],"deaths":["Areo Hotah","Prince Doran Martell","Maester Caleotte","Prince Trystane Martell","Bolton Officer"],"cast":[{"actor":"Peter Dinklage","character":"Tyrion Lannister"},{"actor":"Nikolaj Coster-Waldau","character":"Ser Jaime Lannister"},{"actor":"Lena Headey","character":"Queen Mother Cersei Lannister"},{"actor":"Emilia Clarke","character":"Queen Daenerys Targaryen"},{"actor":"Kit Harington","character":"Jon Snow"},{"actor":"Liam Cunningham","character":"Ser Davos Seaworth"},{"actor":"Carice van Houten","character":"Lady Melisandre"},{"actor":"Natalie Dormer","character":"Queen Margaery Tyrell"},{"actor":"Indira Varma","character":"Ellaria Sand"},{"actor":"Sophie Turner","character":"Princess Sansa Stark"},{"actor":"Maisie Williams","character":"Arya Stark"},{"actor":"Conleth Hill","character":"Varys"},{"actor":"Alfie Allen","character":"Theon Greyjoy"},{"actor":"Gwendoline Christie","character":"Brienne of Tarth"},{"actor":"Jonathan Pryce","character":"the High Sparrow"},{"actor":"Michiel Huisman","character":"Daario Naharis"},{"actor":"Michael McElhatton","character":"Lord Roose Bolton"},{"actor":"Iwan Rheon","character":"Ramsay Bolton"},{"actor":"Iain Glen","character":"Ser Jorah Mormont"},{"actor":"Owen Teale","character":"Ser Alliser Thorne"},{"actor":"Ben Crompton","character":"Eddison Tollett"},{"actor":"Alexer Siddig","character":"Prince Doran Martell"},{"actor":"DeObia Oparei","character":"Areo Hotah"},{"actor":"Faye Marsay","character":"The Waif"},{"actor":"Daniel Portman","character":"Podrick Payne"},{"actor":"Keisha Castle-Hughes","character":"Obara Sand"},{"actor":"Rosabell Laurenti Sellers","character":"Tyene Sand"},{"actor":"Jessica Henwick","character":"Nymeria Sand"},{"actor":"Hannah Waddingham","character":"Septa Unella"},{"actor":"Toby Sebastian","character":"Trystane Martell"},{"actor":"Brenock O'Connor","character":"Olly"},{"actor":"Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson","character":"Ser Gregor Clegane"},{"actor":"Charlotte Hope","character":"Myranda"},{"actor":"Joe Naufahu","character":"Khal Moro"},{"actor":"Chuku Modu","character":"Akho[1]"},{"actor":"Staz Nair","character":"Qhono"},{"actor":"Rubi Ali","character":"a Moro's wife"},{"actor":"Fola Evans-Akingbola","character":"a Moro's wife"},{"actor":"Gerald Lepkowski","character":"Zanrush"},{"actor":"Richard Rycroft","character":"Maester Wolkan"},{"actor":"Diogo Sales","character":"a Moro's bloodrider"},{"actor":"Junade Khan","character":"a Moro's bloodrider"},{"actor":"Sara Dylan","character":"handmaiden"},{"actor":"Brian Fortune","character":"First Builder Othell Yarwyck"},{"actor":"Michael Condron","character":"First Steward Bowen Marsh"},{"actor":"Steve Cash","character":"a loyal Night's Watch man"},{"actor":"Robert Fawsitt","character":"a loyal Night's Watch man"},{"actor":"Michael Hayes","character":"a Night's Watch man"},{"actor":"Tony Flynn","character":"a Night's Watch man"},{"actor":"Andrew Bryan","character":"a Bolton officer"},{"actor":"Tristan Heanue","character":"a Bolton soldier"},{"actor":"Sabina Arthur","character":"a Meereenese homeless mother"},{"actor":"Colin Azzopardi","character":"Maester Caleotte"}]}
